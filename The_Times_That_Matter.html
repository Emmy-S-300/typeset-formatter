I ordinarily wouldn't do that, but the movie was narrated in first person, so I felt like to be true to the source material, I should try it.

    <h2 class="toc-heading">The Times That Matter (1st Person POV)</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>I always knew we were a fairly odd family. First there was me. Too tall. Too skinny. Too blond.</p><p>Then there was my sister– well, she isn't my actual sister, not my blood– she was the daughter of my parents’ best friends, we were born six months apart. But when we were small, she stayed with us whilst her parents went on holiday to Asia, where they contracted dragon pox. They never came back, and Pansy stayed and lived with us.</p><p>She was never one to wallow in sadness, though. For one, she was only two when they died, far too young to remember them. And for another, she chased happiness like a small child chasing butterflies. That is to say, recklessly without watching where they are going.</p><p>And my parents. Father was in the family business, which was a nice way of saying he did nothing for money. Money was just– there. He was always around for a debate on centaur rights, or to play catch the quaffle on our brooms, or for a match of wizarding skittles.</p><p>Mum loved painting and gardening. If you made the mistake of accepting tea with her, your afternoon was hers. As a lady of society, she comported herself with the utmost dignity, but she had no time for layabouts or fools.</p><p>The sole exception to the fools rule was Mum's cousin, Regulus. Regulus had been the pride of his mother's eye once upon a time. But after an unfortunate Quidditch accident at school left him a bit light on reasoning, Great-Aunt Walburga neglected and ignored her son until Mum insisted he move in with her and Father. Regulus might not be able to complete an arithmancy assignment or remember who the Minister of Magic was, but his fashion sense was absolute perfection, and his singing voice was that of an angel’s.</p><p>It was usually just the five of us as Pansy and I were growing up, and that suited us just fine.</p><p>After Pans and I finished at Hogwarts, we'd returned to the manor in Wiltshire, traveling to wizarding university for classes in the mornings. In the afternoons, we played lawn games, read books, and brewed interesting potions. If a few friends happened to visit, we'd have a pickup game of Quidditch.</p><p>Every Friday night, we had a family talent show. Father would quote long passages from muggle novels and occasionally dance, if the firewhiskey hit him right. Pansy told jokes or did acrobatics badly. I played my guitar. Cousin Regulus would sing. And Mum was our fair but impatient judge, keeping us on track.</p><p>Life was simple, and fairly perfect. And then every New Year's, we would fuck it all up by hosting the New Year's Gala.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Every December 31st, we invited everyone we knew to Malfoy Manor. At least half of the guests would do the same thing, so what always started as an intimate affair ended up a raucous, hedonistic festival of debauchery. Particularly once my friend Theo arrived.</p><p>Theo was a bit dodgy. Remarkably extroverted, liked by all right up until the moment that he wasn't. He had a penchant for saying just a bit too much. He was a goofball, but for all of the bad situations he had put me in, he had gotten me into some of my favorite ones as well.</p><p>The New Year's Eve gala when I was 20 was no different. Theo had already knocked over a large tower of champagne glasses, eaten half of the canapes, including several that he claimed to be allergic to, and had broken my cousin's favorite armchair.</p><p>Pansy, likewise, had gotten a handful of friends together to prank and joke with everyone. She, Tracey, and Marietta were running around changing the colors of people's clothing without their noticing, vanishing drinks as they were being sipped, and generally being delightfully annoying.</p><p>At one point, her group approached a few boys that looked vaguely familiar and also vaguely unwelcome. One in particular looked like a douche nozzle of epic proportions, at least judging from his clothing. He wore the grimiest pair of muggle jeans I'd ever seen. His t-shirt read, “Fuck the world. Or better yet, Fuck me.” His gaze, which fell upon Pansy with heavy lust, had the appearance of someone who had recently smoked a lot of pot. In short, he looked like a newly emerged butterfly to Pansy, and she was ready to chase him.</p><p>Somehow, at 11:59pm, Theo managed to maneuver me next to Hannah Abbott, an old school chum. She was blonde, sweet, truly adorable and painfully shy. She and I had known each other for years, even before school. At varying times, each of us had had a crush on the other. This was neither of those times, but at 11:59pm, our choices were slim and getting slimmer by the second.</p><p>
  <em> 10, 9, 8, 7, 6… </em>
</p><p>Hannah and I looked at each other, both of us blushing furiously. Simultaneously we both looked away.</p><p>
  <em> 5, 4, 3…</em>
</p><p>She turned back to me, appearing to make up her mind. She moved in a bit closer, her face angling towards mine.</p><p>
  <em> 2, 1, Happy New Year! </em>
</p><p>I stuck out my hand to shake.</p><p>Across the room, Theo was somehow simultaneously laughing at me and snogging the hottest girl in the room.</p><p>Pansy, meanwhile, had her legs wrapped around the douche nozzle of epic proportions, kissing him passionately.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>That next summer, I turned 21. It was an auspicious occasion, my last to be celebrated whilst living at home with my family. I was moving in the fall to London to practice law at a firm that had both magical and muggle divisions.</p><p>Mum made my favorite apple strudel for breakfast. Cousin Regulus presented me with a finely wrapped box of tissues as a gift. Pansy sang Happy Birthday loudly and off key. But it was Father's gift that would change my life.</p><p>“You wanted to see me, Father?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, Draco. Do come in. I have rather a lot to tell you, and none of it is going to sound normal, I'm afraid.”</p><p>“I would expect nothing less.” I sat down on the leather sofa in his study.</p><p>He paced. “Well, to put it plainly. The men in our family have a unique ability. We can travel through time.”</p><p>I sat for a moment, waiting for the punchline. My father just fixed me with a stare and continued. “Well, the past, not the future. And only within our own lives. We can't change anything big that doesn't affect us, so don't get any grandiose ideas about becoming king or something. We can only go to places where we actually were and can remember. You're not going to be able to go back and kill Grindelwald or shag Rowena Ravenclaw.”</p><p>“I had no intention of trying to shag Rowena Ravenclaw.”</p><p>“Well met, then.”</p><p>“So you're telling me that you and Abraxas and every other man in our family has been able to travel through time?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I don't get the joke.”</p><p>“There's no joke.”</p><p>“Okay, stop. If it's true, which it isn't–”</p><p>“Although it is,” He interjects.</p><p>“Although it isn't, obviously. But if it was, how would I…?”</p><p>“Oh, that is the easy part. All you need is a dark bit of space. A closet, a wardrobe, even a toilet or a scullery will do in a pinch. You go in, close your eyes and clench your fist like this,” and he stood and held his fists as though he were straining against something. “You think of the time you want to go to, and… after a bit of a stumble and a rumble, you go there.”</p><p>“You go there.”</p><p>“You do.”</p><p>“All right. Wow.” I didn't know what the joke was, but I was willing to play along.</p><p>“Well, that's as good as a reaction as any. I believe mine was, fuuuuuck!”</p><p>“Quite,” I said. “All right, I'm going to go downstairs and give this a try. And when I come back and you've had a good laugh at the thought of me standing in my wardrobe clenching my fists in the dark, shall we play some skittles?”</p><p>“Let's.” Lucius settled back into his leather sofa and picked up his mug of tea.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Back in my room, I climbed inside my wardrobe, feeling ridiculous. Where would I go? <em>When would I go?</em></p><p>The answer seemed to come immediately. The last New Year's gala. I had relived that moment of cringe with Hannah Abbott at least one hundred times since then. Perhaps this time, when the stakes were so much lower, I could follow through.</p><p><em>What am I saying?</em> I asked myself. <em>There was no this time, because this wasn't going to happen. </em></p><p>I clenched my fists, called up the half drunken images in my head, and closed my eyes.</p><p>Opening my wardrobe door, the thump of loud electronic music hit my ears. Suddenly, instead of blue striped pyjamas, I wore the hip clothes from that night. What the actual fuck?</p><p>There was a knock on my bedroom door– dodgy Theo asked, “You coming, wanker?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” I answered more than a bit dumbstruck.</p><p>The party was in full swing downstairs. The clock on the mantle read 11:58pm. Theo surreptitiously pointed out Hannah, standing along one wall, looking a bit lonely. I took a deep breath and summoned a bottle of ginger gin from the kitchen. It zoomed into my hand and I took a swig gratefully.</p><p>11:59. I walked over to Hannah.</p><p>“Fun party so far?” I asked smoothly, or what I hoped sounded smoothly.</p><p>“Aces, yeah,” she answered, blushing a bit.</p><p>
  <em> 10, 9, 8, 7, 6… </em>
</p><p>Hannah looks up at me, blushing furiously. Instead of looking away, I raised one eyebrow at her and smirked a bit.</p><p>
  <em> 5, 4, 3…</em>
</p><p>Her blush deepened. She tilted her head a bit, as though she was curious about something. I stepped in close.</p><p>
  <em> 2, 1, Happy New Year! </em>
</p><p>This time, fireworks. Turns out Hannah was a fantastic kisser, and didn't even mind going to my room for a bit of fooling around.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Back in my father's study, I sat down heavily, propping up my pujama clad legs on the ottoman.</p><p>“Does Mum know?”</p><p>“Not even a little,” he said.</p><p>“And what about the whole butterfly effect?”</p><p>“We don't seem to have messed up civilization yet. The whole of the Wizarding World seems much as it always does every time I come back.”</p><p>“It's going to be a complicated year,” I tell him.</p><p>“It's going to be a complicated life,” he smiles. “What do you think you'll use it for?”</p><p>“Probably try to get a girlfriend,” I said honestly.</p><p>“Oh yes. It took me about six tries of introducing myself to your mother to convince her to go out with me.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>A week later, my first opportunity presented itself. Pansy had been dating the twat from the party, Zacharias for about 6 months now, In truth, it turned out that Zacharias had been in our year at Hogwarts, though sorted into a different house. He had left after fifth year to pursue his music. The closest he had gotten so far was fourth row at a Weird Sisters concert.</p><p>One good thing had come of her relationship with Zacharias Smith. Zach’s cousin, Astoria came to stay the summer at the Manor.</p><p>Astoria had also gone to Hogwarts, only two years behind us, and so I never had any classes with her. It was just as well. She was quite beautiful and rather popular, and likely had her choice of boyfriends. Had I been in classes with her, I'm certain I would have royally mucked it up.</p><p>But here in our tiny corner of Wiltshire, the choices were rather light. Cousin Regulus forgot things from earlier in the same conversation. The vicar had a unibrow and large square teeth. I felt like my chances were a solid 50/50.</p><p>Tori had straight blonde hair, a beautiful smile, and a knockout body. She sparkled wherever she went. Theo came around far more often that summer, and the four of us would play two a side Quidditch or tennis or lawn bowling. I don't know if Theo and I ever had the conversation to come to this agreement, but it was the general consensus that we would always try very hard, but lose at whatever game we were playing. Part of this was to see Tori smile widely in victory. The other part of this was to see Tori jump up and down, which was truly spectacular, the stuff of hot showers and middle of the night tugs.</p><p>I used my newfound time traveling skill to my greatest advantage. When I doused her in pumpkin juice at the breakfast table, I immediately rectified it by going back five minutes and passing the marmalade jar less eagerly. When I asked one night outside of the lav if she needed to come in to brush her tits, I shut the door to the toilet in her face at once, saying teeth the next time. When Cousin Regulus told me that he could see the outline of my penis through my trousers, I went back and didn't buy them to save myself the mortification.</p><p>On the last day of her visit, I knocked on Tori's door.</p><p>“Come in!”</p><p>Once inside, I immediately reconsidered. She sat cross-legged on her bed in the shortest, thinnest night dress I had ever seen. I could just make out the outline of her nipples through the top, and I wasn't sure if I could bring myself to speak.</p><p>“Oh! Draco! What brings you by?” She gave me one of those lazy smiles and stretched her arms upwards, causing the night dress to dip a little in the middle. I wondered if I was panting.</p><p>“Just…coming by to…See how your summer was. And– to see if you… that is to say, it's your last night. And I just wanted you to know– Well, I wanted to ask if you were–”</p><p>“Draco.” She put her hand on my leg and smiled up at me, waggling her brows. “Is this about– us? About… love?”</p><p>“Yes,” I exhaled. Thank Merlin, I didn't need to say it.</p><p>“Oh. Draco… it's the last night. It's so sudden. If we kind of perhaps gotten to know each other a bit more, you know, in that way… I wish you hadn't waited until the last night.”</p><p>“So… Don't wait until the last night? Got it.”</p><p>I got up, shut myself into the hallway cupboard, and reemerged 4 weeks earlier.</p><p>I knocked on her door. A different skimpy night dress, same amazing body.</p><p>“Tori, hi. We've spent a few weeks together, and I think we've gotten to know each other pretty well. You and I will be here the rest of the summer and… I was just wondering… What would you say to us… together?”</p><p>She rubbed a circle on my kneecap flirtatiously. “Draco, I'm flattered. But it seems rather early, you know? Why don't we wait until the last night, and you ask me again?”</p><p>Tori smiled alluringly, and I smiled back and left the room. I got the message loud and clear from the universe: You can have a magic wand, all the potions in the world, and even time travel on your side, but you can't make someone love you.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The next day, Tori left for college in Edinburgh, and it was a relief. Life in Wiltshire was back to normal again, for at least one night. The next morning, I left for London.</p><p>Luckily, I had connections in London, and a place to live. Dad's old friend from Hogwarts had also been a professor there when I was going. He'd always been a bit ornery and standoffish, but was a fair teacher, at least to our Hogwarts house. I knew it would be good to have a familiar face in my corner.</p><p>Once in London, I knocked on the door of 10 Spinner's End, but got no answer. A louder knock yielded the same results. It wasn't until the third knock that the door nearly blasted off of its hinges.</p><p>“What the fuck do you want?”</p><p>“Er… Professor Snape? It's… It's Draco. From Hogwarts. Lucius's son. Your godson.” I felt the need to keep reminding him of who I was, because it didn't seem apparent to him.</p><p>“You have disturbed me in my work. I do not appreciate arseholes that knock on my door at 10:00 in the morning expecting entry. So get your <em>shit</em> and carry it upstairs.”</p><p>He continued his diatribe as we mounted the rickety staircase to the top floor. “The first good idea that I've had in a year, and then some shitbag begins banging on my door like a team of Aurors coming to take me at wand point.”</p><p>“Sorry about that, Professor,” I begin.</p><p>“Draco, I left sniveling children and the teaching profession three years ago after I wrote my first play. I have gone on to sell two more, and if your very presence doesn't cost me my creativity, joie de vivre, and will to live, perhaps I will sell another soon.”</p><p>“Sorry, Professor.”</p><p>“For the sake of Merlin's bollocks and my own sanity, please call me Severus. Or Sev.”</p><p>We passed a small cluster of frames. In one of the photos, an attractive, petite woman blew a kiss over and over to the photographer and ran away.</p><p>Severus saw me looking at one in particular and sent a small blasting hex at the frame, which bounced clumsily against the wall before resetting.</p><p>“My ex wife.”</p><p>“I didn't know you were married.”</p><p>“Yes, after I lost the love of my life to some blowhard toe rag at school, she was there to help me pick up the pieces. Unfortunately, it turns out she was just there to rearrange them into newer, smaller pieces.”</p><p>I wasn't sure what to say to this. We continued up the staircase to a small bedroom that was clearly decorated by a young, wizard-crazy girl. Leering, vaguely sexual photographs of male models and singers, both wizarding and muggle, covered every surface.</p><p>“Please try to keep the level of noise down in here whilst I am working. I will warn you, the bed creaks a lot. It gets especially loud and obnoxious during sex,” Severus said drolly.</p><p>“Well, very little chance of that happening,” I say with self-deprecation. I moved to examine the photographs on the desk.</p><p>“That's my daughter, Eileena. Have sex with her if you like. Apparently everyone else does.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Getting a girlfriend proved difficult. Work didn't help. Practicing law takes up a lot of time and is apparently full of either wizards or muggle men. My first day as a junior associate, I met my new office mate, Ernie. Actually, I was meeting him again. Ernie had been in my year at Hogwarts, though sorted into Hufflepuff. He was an all right bloke, but a bit buttoned-up and even more of a fumbling mess than I was when it came to women.</p><p>Six months passed with no end in sight to the dry spell of obtaining a girlfriend. Then one Friday night in January, Theo invited me to try a new restaurant called Noir in Diagon Alley. Rather than the typical velvet chairs, linen tablecloths, and low lighting, this place had its guests sitting entirely in the dark– and with strangers. It sounded like a complete waste of time, but Theo was insistent and it wasn't like I had better options.</p><p>Theo and I stumbled through the dining room and sat down. It was pitch black; we couldn't see a thing, even our hands in front of our faces. The waiter informed us that we were seated across from two witches around our age.</p><p>“Hello,” a sultry voice from somewhere in front of me said. The voice dripped with honey and sex. I could not see Theo, but I could feel the interest radiating off of him palpably.</p><p>“Hello, darling. I'm Jonathan, this is Thomas. With whom do we have the pleasure of dining?”</p><p>We had not discussed using fake names, but it actually seemed like a solid idea. The wizarding world is small, and with a name like Draco Malfoy, I was rather easily identified.</p><p>The girl was answering now. “I'm Jasmine, and this is my friend–”</p><p>“Samantha.” Another voice broke in. It was sweet and light, but seemed to have so much warmth. It gave me a warm tingle in the back of my mind, almost like a memory. I wondered if I knew her from Hogwarts, but I couldn't recall a Samantha.</p><p>“It's lovely to meet you,” I said, trying to project my nicest sounding voice. Perhaps if she couldn't see my gangly awkwardness, she would fall in love with my dulcet tones, I thought laughingly.</p><p>The first course was served. Jasmine and Theo fell almost immediately into an innuendo laden discussion of strawberries and sausages. This left me with Samantha, which actually suited me just fine.</p><p>Within minutes, we found that we had much in common. Both of us enjoyed reading in our spare time and potions back in school, though her favorite subject had been Transfigurations. Her parents did something in the medical profession, and from the bit that she related, sounded like they might have been muggles.</p><p>“Are you muggle-born?” I asked with interest.</p><p>“Yes– does that bother you?” She suddenly sounded a bit worried.</p><p>“No! No, I've just– Well, I've never dated a muggle-born witch. But I've always found the muggle world fascinating.”</p><p>We exchanged pleasantries about our professions– she seemed impressed with my lawyering, and likewise I was fascinated with her occupation as a book editor.</p><p>“So, it isn't just that you like to read. You're paid to read?”</p><p>“Well, yes, I suppose you could say that.”</p><p>“How unusual. It's like being paid to breathe,” I joked, and Samantha laughed a light but full-bellied laugh that a small part of me instantly fell in love with, and also stirred old feelings of almost familiarity within me. I made it my mission to hear it again as soon as possible.</p><p>“What are you reading right now?” I asked.</p><p>“For work or for leisure?”</p><p>“Leisure.”</p><p>“Oh! Well, you know, Gilderoy Lockhart is putting out a new retrospective, a follow-up to his previous memoir, ‘Magical Me.’ I've ordered a copy from Flourish and Blotts, to be delivered Monday. They are doing several guest lectures with him during evenings at the shop this coming week. I'm hoping to finish the book and come and see him there this week.”</p><p>“Well, that sounds lovely. Perhaps I'll join you,” I said, making a mental note to read a summary of every Lockhart book as quickly as I could.</p><p>“Mmm. Yes, I also really enjoyed his ‘Galavanting with Goblins.’ Though, it certainly put me off of going into the banking profession,” she said jokingly.</p><p>This started a long discussion about Lockhart's books, and about contentiousness between wizardkind and goblins. Whilst Samantha and I did not agree on every point, I found the conversation lively and engaging.</p><p>“So what do you look like?” She asked curiously.</p><p>“Er– tall. Blond. My skin is rather transparent. Rather like a demiguise in human form.”</p><p>There was that lovely laugh again.</p><p>“And you?” I asked her.</p><p>“Mmm. Mousy brown hair. Rather curly. And I'm short. I think I look like a curly haired squirrel.”</p><p>“I love squirrels,” I said, and I found that I did.</p><p>Another laugh. “Nobody loves squirrels.”</p><p>“Well I mean, not actual squirrels.”</p><p>We laughed again, and in the ensuing lull in our conversation, we caught a bit of dirty talk from the other side of our table between Jasmine and “Jonathan.”</p><p>“What does your friend Jonathan look like?” Samantha asked.</p><p>“Ehh. Like a more awkward version of me. But with brown hair.” No need to play up Theo's dashing playboy good looks. He had enough attention from Jasmine as it was. “What does Jasmine look like?”</p><p>“Bit like a prostitute,” and she laughed hard once more. “But like a really nice prostitute. Very high end.”</p><p>“That's good, Jonathan has more galleons than sense, so they sound perfect for each other.”</p><p>She laughed once more. It sounded like music.</p><p>For the next two hours, I stopped trying to place her face in my mind and just focused on our conversation. Samantha was so easy to talk to, clearly very intelligent, and seemed absolutely delightful.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Standing outside on the cobblestone pavement, Theo and I nervously waited for Jasmine and Samantha to walk out. I was fervently hoping that there wasn't a second exit down by the lavatories, when the door to the restaurant opened.</p><p>The first person to step out was Ginny Weasley, wearing a very low cut black dress with a slit up the side to show off her slender, pale legs. With her beautiful flaming red hair and careful makeup, she did, indeed, look like a very high-end, devastatingly beautiful prostitute. She gave Theo a slow smile.</p><p>“Jonathan, is it? I had a feeling it might be you,” Ginny said teasingly. She linked arms with Theo. “How have you been?”</p><p>It is then that I remembered that she and Theo had a one night stand during our last month or so at Hogwarts. The two of them tripped away a little drunkenly further down Diagon Alley, and the door to Noir opened once more.</p><p>Out stepped Hermione Granger.</p><p>My breath caught in my lungs and couldn't seem to escape.</p><p>Back in school, Hermione Granger was known as the know-it-all swot, eager to earn the top marks in every class. She was a Gryffindor, and was known to champion all sorts of causes, from the rights of house elves to the ethical treatment of centaurs. Her passion for knowledge and fairness, her petite but fierce stature, not to mention a great body, made her feature rather often in both my nighttime dreams and my waking ones. I would be lying if I said I hadn't seen her face and body a few times when I rubbed one out at night.</p><p>But generally speaking, Slytherins were known as not being particularly accepting towards muggle-borns, which was presumably why she had always seemed a bit prickly in our one-on-one conversations. That had led to me being a bit standoffish towards her, as well.</p><p>Now, her eyes– lovely copper colored eyes that seemed to sparkle with magic, just as they had back at Hogwarts– widened in surprise.</p><p>“Draco? Draco Malfoy?” Her brow furrowed a bit. “I wasn't expecting… you.”</p><p>“Nor I, you, Granger,” I said, although once I thought about it, my imagination had not been far off. The entire night, I had been imagining lush chocolate curls and the tops of smooth, creamy breasts– and sugar quills. Granger had been addicted to them back at Hogwarts, and it was a common sight to see her delicately biting and sucking at one during class. I'm certain I wasn't the only wizard that spent the whole of History of Magic watching that show.</p><p>And of course she would also give a fake name. There was only one Hermione.</p><p>“For the record, you make a beautiful squirrel.” I smirked in what I prayed was a winning, confident manner and put out one hand, grasping hers. I brought the backs of her fingers to my lips and brushed a kiss across them, holding her copper gaze in what I hoped was a flirtatious and not creepy way.</p><p>She laughed that same melodic laugh that I had come to crave. “And demiguise does seem rather accurate for you.” She gave me a slow smile that lit up her face. “So… You like my hair?”</p><p>“I love it,” I proclaimed.</p><p>“The fringe is new.”</p><p>“I love the fringe.”</p><p>“And my frock? You don't think it's too… frumpy?” She ran a hand over the red a-line dress that showed off her arms and just a hint of her decolletage, and which stopped a few inches above her knees.</p><p>“It's my favorite frock. I adore it,” I enthused.</p><p>She blushed and bit her lip, looking away.</p><p>“Can I call you?” I asked, taking my chance.</p><p>“I would like that,” she said, her burnished copper eyes staring up into mine, eyebrow lifting just a bit.</p><p>She conjured a slip of paper and took out a muggle pen, writing something on it and tucking it into the breast pocket of my coat. “That's my address, give me a floo sometime this week. Maybe we can go to that Lockhart lecture together.”</p><p>“I would love that,” I said.</p><p>Theo and Ginny stumbled back around the corner from the side of Florean Fortescue's ice cream parlor. Both heads of hair were far more rumpled, Ginny's dress was hiked up enough to catch a small glimpse of red lace underwear, and Theo's fly was unzipped. They were both laughing.</p><p>“Mione! Let's go! This dodgy ‘Jonathan’ bloke is getting far too handsy!” Ginny giggled, grabbing Theo by the waistband of his trousers and pulling him along behind her. “Let's go take the floo back to my flat from the Leaky, I'm too bollocksed to apparate.”</p><p>Hermione turned back to me with a lopsided grin. “I should get her back to her flat and pour her into bed. The Weasleys brunch every Saturday, she’ll need Pepper-up potion to make it there on time, I think.”</p><p>I smiled and nodded, still holding her gaze. “I'll call you,” I said.</p><p>Then I leaned forward and brushed my lips against her cheek lightly. I couldn't help but notice that she leaned a bit into me before she pulled away.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I was still riding high off my dinner with Hermione when I met Sev in our kitchen. He looked thunderous. A bottle of fire whiskey, unopened that morning, was three quarters gone.</p><p>His new play had opened tonight. This did not look promising.</p><p>“Severus? How was the play?”</p><p>Severance turned his unfocused gaze upon me. “It was bloody glorious. Truly like the second coming of a divine being. Angels sang in the orchestra pit, tears were in the eye of every old matron in the place. A real work of art. Right up until Lord Alfred Covington absolutely shit the bed.”</p><p>“Sorry, come again?”</p><p>“Shit. The. Bed. The man has won more awards than any living stage actor, and yet he has the memory of a sieve. He insisted, however, that he had everything in hand.”</p><p>Severus took a very long, sloppy swig of the fire whiskey, gulped it down, and smacked his lips loudly. “Suffice to say, he did not have everything in hand. He shit. The. Bed. We got to the courtroom scene and he froze on the stage for a solid 7 minutes. And so, tonight was both our opening and our closing night. It was the Titanic of play openings, but with no survivors. All dead.”</p><p>“Ah, I see.”</p><p>“Do you? Do you, Draco? Because, I tell you, I am finished. I can never show my face in this town again.” Severus dropped his head to the table with a loud thunk.</p><p>“No, I'm sure it's not–”</p><p>“Yes.” He spoke without raising his head. “You don't understand. The show was already 4 months delayed. My backers needed an instant hit. They are pulling their funding and they don't plan to fund my next one. Believe me when I say, I cannot show my face in this town again.”</p><p>“Give me just a minute,” I said bracingly. I stepped into the nearby cupboard and stepped out six hours before.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“Ready for the show? I'm really looking forward to it.” I said to Severus.</p><p>He stood over his kitchen sink, rolling a cigarette. He was dressed the same as he had been moments before, but far less disheveled.He gave me an ugly glare.</p><p>“Fuck off. You think you're coming to my show? And I suppose you think I magically have a ticket for you?”</p><p>“Just thought you'd like a bit of support.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Once at the theater, Severus ignored me entirely in favor of chatting up his leading lady. He had discovered her tending bar at a dive on Horizont Alley and had been trying to get into her knickers for a solid half year.</p><p>I knocked on the door of the dressing room of Lord Alfred Covington. The portly man sat at the makeup vanity, eating the largest sandwich I had ever seen.</p><p>“Ah- Lord Covington? Ready for tonight?”</p><p>“Who the fuck are you?” Covington said around a mouthful of ham and green olives.</p><p>“I'm a big fan, sir. A friend of Sev’s. Just– wanted to make sure that you are all right with your lines. Would you perhaps like to run that courtroom scene again?” I asked superciliously.</p><p>“Take your namby pamby wishy washy nonsense and fuck off out of here, will you? Or I'll have to give you the old one, two!” the rotund man roared at me.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The play was indeed going splendidly as Sev had said. The lights came up on the courtroom scene and I held my breath.</p><p>The leading lady cued Covington. “Do the Prosecution have anything final to add?”</p><p>“Ladies, Gentlemen…” he began. Then he froze. And stood there, staring dumbly at everyone on stage.</p><p>“Excuse me. Excuse me. Ma'am? I just need to–” I tripped my way up my aisle, hurrying for the nearest closet, ignoring Severus’s ugly stare.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“Do the Prosecution have anything final to add?”</p><p>From backstage, Covington's fat arse looked even fatter.</p><p>“Ladies, Gentlemen…”</p><p>And… silence.</p><p>“Psst!” I called in a loud stage whisper from the wings.</p><p>I held up the large cue cards I had made. He locked eyes with me, fear draining away as he began his assault on his rousing monologue.</p><p>Ladies, Gentlemen, I regard today's proceedings with the utmost gravity…”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The cast party after the opener was in full swing, and Severus had managed to get the leading lady to sit on his lap, which was progress for him.</p><p>I tipped my cup at him from across the room as he flipped me off. I reached into my jacket pocket to find Hermione's address. Perhaps tomorrow morning wouldn't be too early to call, I mused.</p><p>Except for a small tin of spearmint breath mints, my pocket was empty. I checked all of the seams, looking for a hole that the tiny scrap of parchment might have fallen into. There was nothing.</p><p>Shit, I thought. My first good date in forever, and I had to go and erase it.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Excusing myself from the party, I rushed to the nearest apparition point, apparating directly into the electrical closet off of an alley behind the Adelphi Theater, the nearest apparition point in Charing Cross to Diagon Alley. I never truly understood why witches and wizards could not apparate directly into Diagon Alley, but no one asked me, I suppose.</p><p>Racing across the cobblestones to Noir, I found the head waiter closing up for the night. “Excuse me, sir– earlier tonight, two ladies were here dining. A redhead in a black dress and a beautiful witch with curly brown hair and a lovely red number. I'm not sure what name they gave– possibly Jasmine or Samantha? Did they by chance pay with a cheque? One of them gave me her address and I lost it.”</p><p>The man was kind enough to look, but they had paid with cash.</p><p>I walked slowly in defeat along Diagon Alley. What absolute shit luck. I find a gorgeous, funny, intelligent witch, we have an amazing evening together, she actually seems potentially interested in seeing me again, and I go and ruin it.</p><p>True, I could try to find a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend who might know her address or where she was working currently. But in her mind, we had not seen each other in well over 3 years, since Hogwarts. Even then, we had barely spoken more than fifty words to each other over the course of seven years of schooling. How strange would it look, then, for the standoffish Slytherin to floo call her out of nowhere?</p><p>I stopped outside of a well-lit shop window, barely noticing the over the top window display. But then, my eyes focused. Inside the window, a tiny marionette of a man was enchanted to fight all manner of werewolves, ghouls, yetis and the like. The little routine finished, and a sign was raised behind him.</p><p> </p><center>

</p><p>This was the way, then.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Monday at 3:45 pm, I passed through the brick barrier behind the Leaky Cauldron and my eyes were assaulted by a gaggle of witches. Heaving a monstrous sigh, I found my way to the outskirts of the group, which put me directly in front of Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor.</p><p>“Scoop of strawberry whilst you wait?” Florian gave me a knowing look. He and I were no strangers, as his strawberry ice cream was truly top-notch.</p><p>“I don't suppose you have fire whiskey flavored ice cream do you? I'm trying to orchestrate a meetup with a witch, and she's one of these… lusting ladies.” I gestured to the crowd.</p><p>To his credit, Florian suppressed a laugh and said, “sure, come on in. I can make you a whiskey vanilla float.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Bolstered by the float, I made my way across the street at 4:30.</p><p>Five hours later, I had to accept the conclusion that she hadn't come. Only four more nights of this.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Tuesday was the same, except that Ernie tagged along after hearing about all the witches. However Tuesday's lecture was mostly about banshees and trolls, and didn't draw nearly the same crowd as Mondays yeti and werewolf discussion.</p><p>On Wednesday, Pansy came with. She’d moved to London a few weeks after me. She had not had as easy a time with school as I had, and she had come to be a hostess at a trendy bar in the West End. She was also living with Zacharias, which seemed like a horrible idea to me, but she hadn't asked my opinion.</p><p>We found a bench, and were sharing a bag of salt and vinegar crisps. I was scanning the crowd for at least the thirtieth time since we had arrived two hours before. Suddenly, there she was.</p><p>She was wearing a lovely pink and burgundy Fair Isle sweater and a pair of muggle jeans that clung to her body like a second skin. Soft brown boots came up nearly to her knees. She looked amazing. I stood up from the bench where my legs had been falling asleep for the last hour and a half, disturbing Pansy's slumber.</p><p>“She's here,” I breathed. “How do I look?”</p><p>“Like an absolute knob end,” Pansy said affectionately, messing up my hair.</p><p>I groaned in annoyance as I pushed the white blonde hair back into place, then I sucked my teeth to make sure there were no bits of crisp in them. I popped a spearmint in my mouth and turned to make my way to her, but I found that I was immediately upon her, practically stepping on her toes and bowling her over. Evidently she had seen and was coming over to say hello to an old familiar face from school.</p><p>“Er– Malfoy! Um, Draco, sorry. Hi,” she said, her cheeks blushing to match her sweater.</p><p>“Hermione! You finally made it! I was beginning to get worried. Good to see you at last!” In the surprised discombobulation of quite literally bumping into her and almost knocking her to the ground, I forgot all of the smooth introductions that I’d come up with in the hours of waiting.</p><p>“Er– okay. I didn't realize you… Are you a– big fan of Lockhart's, then?” she frowned.</p><p>I can feel a blush creeping up my neck. Wizards were outnumbered easily six to one in the shop, and most of those that were here clearly preferred to stir their cauldrons anticlockwise.</p><p>“Oh. Well. Well no, not really. But my sister Pansy– You remember her, right? From Hogwarts? She's a massive fan, she practically dragged me here,” I told her, pointing out the traitorous Pansy who was still trying to catch a kip on the bench. “Although I have to say I do enjoy some of his works.”</p><p>“Really? What's your favorite?” She asked with one eyebrow raised.</p><p>“Er– “Galavanting with Goblins.’ Truly inspiring. Do you mind if I walk with you? There are some lovely displays, I know you're going to enjoy the one on the follow-up sequel to ‘Magical Me.’”</p><p>She gave me a confused look. “How do you know that I will?”</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>“You said that you know that I’ll enjoy the one on the follow-up to ‘Magical Me’. But how do you know?”</p><p>“Er– You just look like you would,” I said, taking her hand and tucking it into the crook of my elbow.</p><p>As a newly minted expert in the field of Gilderoy Lockhart, having spent many hours studying every display, I gave her a wonderful tour of Flourish and Blotts, pointing out all of the funny bits about Gilderoy’s childhood as well as the most interesting photographs. She continued to marvel that I knew so much.</p><p>“And how is the book editing going?”</p><p>“How did you know–” she started, but I interrupted quickly.</p><p>“I just know you always spent so much time in the library at Hogwarts. It only made sense then you would take a job in the literary field,” I said brusquely. Best move past that. ”Say, Are you interested in getting an ice cream? Florian makes a delicious whiskey float that you might like.”</p><p>“Actually, I was going to meet Ginny in the Leaky in about ten minutes–”</p><p>“Fabulous, I'd love to join,” I said smoothly, as though I had been asked. “I've really got a hankering for their steak and kidney pie.”</p><p>“Really?” Hermione cocked her head. “I never got the impression that you and Ginny got along that well at Hogwarts, Malfoy.”</p><p>“Water under the bridge,” I waved my hand as though it meant nothing that Ginny's older brother Ron had not caused the singular most embarrassing moment of my Hogwarts career.</p><p>Ronald Weasley and I had never been friends, but we generally stayed out of each other's way at Hogwarts. Apparently, well before our time, there had been a lot of strife between our families. But even with this knowledge, and the fact that we played on opposing Quidditch teams, me a seeker and him, keeper– we still managed to stay civil with each other. Yes, his red hair was a crime against humanity, but he could not help it, he was born that way.</p><p>That all went away during our sixth year. We were working in pairs on human transfiguration, changing each other's hair color– the theory being that it would be easier to change another person's, rather than your own. I had gotten stuck with Ron Weasley because Theo had been skivving off that day. Looking back, perhaps I should have been blaming Theo all these years.</p><p>But it was Weasley who made the mistake of mixing up his notes from Transfigurations with ones from Care of Magical Creatures. He only recalled that the incantation began with the letters M and F. So rather than using the incantation “mutatio folliculus,” he instead said “mustela furo.” This, as it turns out, is the proper name of a dubious creature known more commonly as a white ferret. Which is what I turned into.</p><p>Professor McGonagall had left the room momentarily, so there was no one to help for a solid five minutes. And as suddenly everyone in the room appeared to be a giant to me, it was highly frightening. I was called some variation of jumpy, twitchy, and trembly for months after this.</p><p>Suffice it to say, Ron Weasley and I were never going to be friends after that.</p><p>But Ginny was her own person, and besides, she was good friends with Hermione, so she couldn't be all bad.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“So, Draco, tell me more about this Gilderoy Lockhart obsession. I mean, I've heard all about him over the years from Hermione and my mother, but I'd love to know what you see in him.” Ginny Weasley's eyes sparkled mischievously above her grin, and I got the sense that trouble making was her job, whilst being the up-and-coming phenom chaser for the Holyhead Harpies was just a hobby.</p><p>“Oh, yes, Lockhart is simply amazing. He really tells it like it is. But enough about him. Granger, tell me about you. What have you been up to?” I made the mistake of looking her in the eyes and was immediately transfixed by their coppery brown depths.</p><p>“Ah. Well, you know I'm a book editor now– not sure exactly how you know that, who did you hear that from? I usually kind of try to keep it to myself. It prevents a lot of truly awful manuscripts from being foisted upon me in pubs and toilet stalls.”</p><p>“Er– not sure. Pansy must've learned it from your friend, Violet,” I said, hoping that she and her old Hogwarts roommates still kept in touch.</p><p>Her brow furrowed delightfully. “Do you mean Lavender?”</p><p>“Yes, that's the one. And– What else? I like what you've done with your hair, is that new?”</p><p>Her hands reached up, self-consciously tugging at the fringe. “No, Malfoy– this is my same hair. Don't you remember taking the piss out on it our first year?”</p><p>My stomach lurched with an awful feeling, and my face must have matched, because she giggled. “Don't worry too much about it. You weren't the only one. I didn't really know how to use conditioner back then.”</p><p>“Ah, yes, you've really got to massage it in–” here, I cringed hard internally. Why was I fucking exchanging hair tips with this witch when I was already known as the Lockhart obsessed weirdo who invited himself to a girl's night out?</p><p>Thankfully, I was rescued by the waitress bringing our drinks. I took Ginny's and my fire whiskeys and Hermione's ginger gin and tonic, which was accompanied by a small bowl of lemons.</p><p>“Gin and tonic?” I placed the drink in front of her.</p><p>“Yes!” she said with a smile.</p><p>“Lemons?”</p><p>“Yes!” She said, taking the bowl.</p><p>“Boyfriend?”</p><p>“Yes!” She said, still smiling.</p><p>“No,” I said, just a little bit horror struck.</p><p>“What? Do I not look like someone who would have a boyfriend?” She asked, looking a bit crestfallen.</p><p>“No, that's not it. Er– is this… somewhat new?”</p><p>She blushed a bit as she answered, “Yes– we've only met a few days ago– but we've really hit it off. Dimitri is one of Viktor Krum’s teammates. They had a match against the Harpies last night, but the team came into town Saturday. Oh– here he is!”</p><p>Standing near the door of the Leaky were two musclebound, broad shouldered men who looked as though they bench pressed boulders. One raised a hand in greeting to our table, and they started our way. The crown parted, giving them a wide berth– no one wanted to create a row with either of these men.</p><p>“Dimitri! Viktor! Glad you could come!” Hermione tilted her face up to accept a kiss from the brawnier of the two, and I worked hard to wipe the look of disbelief and slight panic off of my face.</p><p>“Dimitri, pleased to meet you. I'm Draco, I am an old friend of Hermione's,” I said, sticking out my hand to shake.</p><p>“Hermione not say she was bringing friend,” the heavy browed man said in confusion.</p><p>“We just ran into each other, and we're catching up on old times,” I said, trying not to notice the silent laughter that the Weaselette was devolving into.</p><p>“Hey, Vik– let's dance,” Ginny said, grabbing the other wizard's arm. Despite the fact that no one else was dancing, the two of them made their way to a clear area of floor and began shimmying to the beat. Within thirty seconds, five couples had joined them.</p><p>“I found Draco at the Lockhart lecture series, and he wanted to grab a drink and dinner as well, so…”</p><p>The huge wizard relaxed back into his seat, and my eyes studiously avoided the man's hugely muscled arm as it slung itself possessively around her shoulders.</p><p>“So, Dimitri. How did the two of you meet?” I asked amicably.</p><p>“We meet at pub. Welcome party for players.” Dimitri was not a man of many words, at least not English ones.</p><p>“Yes, Ginny dragged me along, and it was honestly a bit miserable. Dimitri wasn't having a great time either and we met and started talking and we just clicked. We decided to leave and grab dinner together.”</p><p>“Lovely. And when and where was that, exactly?” I asked innocently, a plan forming in my mind. I pasted on my best smile.</p><p>“Oh, it was Saturday. The Harpies hosted a welcome social, since this was a friendly match.”</p><p>Still smiling, I asked again, “Yes, yes, but when and where? I like to form detailed pictures in my mind.”</p><p>Hermione looked at me a bit uncertainly, but said gamely enough, “It was Saturday at the Crash and Burn.”</p><p>The Crash and Burn was the Quidditch and cigar pub that the Weasley twins opened the previous year in Liverpool. It had been a spectacular success, and I'd read in the Prophet that they planned to open two more later that year.</p><p>“I hear such great things. What time did you arrive, Granger?”</p><p>Now she looked utterly perplexed, but offered, “I think about… 8? I had to work late and I remember flooing directly to Ginny’s flat because she was supposed to be there at 8:00. I had to wear one of her outfits, and I remember not having a chance to eat. I was famished!”</p><p>I turned my winning smile on Dimitri. “And you, Dim? What time did you get there?”</p><p>Dimitri looked confused too, but finally answered, “we come about 9:00. Late practice.”</p><p>“That's perfect, thanks.” I grabbed my coat and made to leave, but Hermione stopped me.</p><p>“Aren't you going to order some food? Didn't you say you were hungry?”</p><p>“Er– stomachache. Think I'll just pop home and take a bit of toast with jam instead.”</p><p>I was into the floo and exiting at Sev's flat on a matter of seconds. I needed to get to Liverpool immediately.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Severus had made plenty of headway with the leading lady from his play– rather literally. When I stepped out of the floo, I was promptly greeted with the sight of Sev lying on his back on the sofa, The Who’s ‘Behind Blue Eyes’ blasting at full volume from the muggle stereo in the corner. Crouched between his legs, eyes closed, wearing nothing but a neon pink thong, the woman was sucking Severus's stiff cock like it was the fountain of youth itself.</p><p>I froze, and Sev raised one finger to his lips– Shh. The woman did not hear me, as the music and her loud moans and gags had drowned out the sound of the floo.</p><p>Sev mouthed the words Get The Fuck Out. I did so, sprinting catlike for the stairs and trying very hard to block out the squelching and moaning. This was the man I'd seen in classes every school day for seven years. He had given me careers advice, for Merlin's sake. In all that time, I never thought I would see his throbbing dick get absolutely swallowed by a pert red head ten years his junior.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I flooed directly to the Crash and Burn, stepping out to find a surprisingly lively crowd for a Wednesday night. It became clear after a moment that it was trivia night based on the huge screen in the center of the bar area. Teams were gathered around the bar, listening carefully to the questioner, a tall girl with long braids that I somehow associated with Quidditch.</p><p>I was trying to blend into the background as I crossed the bar area in an effort to find the restrooms. My plan was simple; I’d go back to Saturday night around 8:15 and intercept Hermione before she even had a chance to meet Dimitri. If I entered the event from the restrooms, no one would question my credentials in being there.</p><p>Unfortunately, my way was blocked by a man returning from the bar with drinks for his table. “Oi- budge up there– er, Malfoy?”</p><p>I peered into his face and placed it quickly. Harry Potter was the Gryffindor seeker from my year at Hogwarts. He was a bit of a legacy like I was, both of us likely earning our spots on our respective Quidditch teams because of our fathers’ reputations. He was an all right bloke. The only thing I had to say against him, really, was that his best friend was the ferret transfiguring Ronald Weasley.</p><p>But Weasley was nowhere to be seen tonight, and Potter looked to be in high spirits. “Well, this is perfect! Neville and Owen and I need a fourth for our team for just a few minutes until Dean gets here. What say you, Draco?”</p><p>Ordinarily, I enjoyed trivia, but it was already getting late and I still had a witch to woo and, if I played my cards right, dinner and a date afterwards.</p><p>“Oh, hi– Potter. Actually, I was just on my way to the loo.”</p><p>“But you just came in from the floo,” Owen Potter said a bit too shrewdly as he walked up to us. “Did you come from somewhere that didn't have a toilet?”</p><p>Owen was Potter's little brother, though he was nearly a head taller than his bespectacled older sibling. Whereas Harry Potter was generally an open book– intuitive, friendly to almost anyone, rather easy going– Owen was incredibly smart and much more straight-laced. He didn't make friends easily, but the ones he did make stuck by his side no matter what.</p><p>“Oh– uh, yes. Sorry, I just– I said, I just came from the floo.”</p><p>Owen seemed unconvinced by my lie, but let it go when his brother asked again. “So, whaddya think, Malfoy? You in? We've got to have four to sign up. They've got some good categories tonight, plus it'll only be about 20 minutes. Dean is dining with his family tonight. They're still a bit uncomfortable with the two of us together, so we're taking it kind of slow with them.”</p><p>“Right. I heard you two were together, yeah. Congrats on that, by the way.” In my head, I was calculating how many questions I'd need to tank before they wanted me gone.</p><p>“Thanks, Malfoy. So? Are you in? ‘Snitch, Please’ really needs a fourth.”</p><p>“Sure,” I said, following the Potter brothers to their table. I shook hands with Neville Longbottom, another wizard from our year, another Gryffindor like Harry and Dean. “Neville, how are you? Business going well?”</p><p>“Hey Draco, long time, no see. Yeah, a lot of people don't realize how busy the floral market is in winter, but I've been traveling to so many hothouses across Europe, I've practically worn out my welcome at the Ministry transportation office, requesting portkeys…”</p><p>Neville was off on a plant tangent that he stayed on until the elder Potter returned from the bar with a spiced vodka and soda for me and a plate of chips with cheese and bacon for the table.</p><p>“So, Malfoy. What have you been up to since school ended? I heard you were at Cambridge?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Law,” I said. “Dreadfully boring.”</p><p>Neville and Harry chuckled a bit, but Owen seemed confused. “If it's dreadfully boring, why did you do it?”</p><p>“Er– well, for the ladies.” I laughed and turned back to the two wizards from my grade. “Nev, I know you're managing Leaves and Sheaves in Diagon. Potter? You're at the Ministry?”</p><p>“DMLE, Auror Division,” Potter nodded around a forkful of chips laden with cheese.</p><p>“More power to you– my mom and dad were hoping I'd go that path, follow in their footsteps, but it never appealed to me,” Neville offered.</p><p>“Yeah, if your heart wasn't in it, you'd have had a hard time making it in our year group anyway, Nev. You know Ron, Dean, and Millie Bulstrode all from our year applied, and I was the only one to make it in.”</p><p>I suddenly realized what a golden opportunity had just fallen into my lap. I just had to figure out how to work my way around to it.</p><p>“So, I know Weasley is working for his brothers in their varied business ventures. Millie got some other job in the Ministry I believe..What's Dean up to these days?”</p><p>“He's doing marketing for the Flint conglomerate. They publish the Witch Weekly, Wandering Wizard, and Wistful magazines. He does the travel layouts for Wandering,” said Potter fondly.</p><p>“That's great. Who else was in your year group? Let's see, Seamus Finnegan. And Hermione Granger. Wasn't one of the Patil twins in Gryffindor as well?”</p><p>“Seamus is working in that dragon preserve in Romania and I think Hermione does something in publishing. Parvati just opened a spa in Diagon Alley.”</p><p>“Right, I remember Granger always in the library,” I said, going for a casual tone. “Didn't the two of you have something going at one time?”</p><p>“It was mainly just a little flirtation, some back and forth at the beginning of fourth year. You remember in our third year, when Gryffindor beat Hufflepuff, and then the next year, the Hufflepuff captain, Diggory, won the triwizard tournament? Everyone on the Gryffindor team kind of benefited from him being chosen to compete, if you know what I mean. All of us were able to score some serious points with the witches, being able to brag that we had beaten the Hogwarts Triwizard champion.” They all shared a laugh.</p><p>The main thing I remembered about Hermione in fourth year was the sight of her in her dress at the Yule Ball that year.</p><p>Potter continued. “Actually, she and Nev were a lot more serious. Didn't the two of you date for most of seventh year?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Neville said in a retrospective tone. “She was amazing, but we just didn't work out. I went out with Susan right after that, then Hannah. I didn't get together with Luna until a couple of years after we finished school.”</p><p>Inwardly, I cringed. I'd barely had two girlfriends all through my years at Hogwarts. Tracey Davis had gone to Yule Ball with me and we'd dated until spring. And Sally Anne Perkins and I had fooled around a bit in sixth year and again in seventh. How was it that the awkwardly gangly Neville Longbottom had been with more witches than I had?</p><p>Then again, Neville had begun interning with Professor Sprout in Herbology in sixth year, and I recall more than one girl from my house of Slytherin commenting about getting hot and sweaty in the greenhouses.</p><p>The world of law was looking less lucrative by the minute. But never mind that, I had a mission to focus on.</p><p>“Did she ever talk about me?” I asked quickly.</p><p>“Luna?” Neville wrinkled his nose.</p><p>“No, Hermione– Granger. Did she ever… I don't know, point me out or say anything about me?” I knew how weird this line of questioning sounded, but with any luck, none of these wizards would remember this conversation, because it wouldn't happen once I'd gone back to last Saturday.</p><p>“Uh…” The two other Gryffindors looked at each other a bit too knowingly. Finally, Harry said, “I seem to remember her commenting after you turn into a ferret that you made a nice looking ferret. Is that what you mean?”</p><p>I contained my sigh of annoyance, but just barely. “I guess so,”</p><p>But it was Owen who gave me the best bit of information.</p><p>“I remember her during my fourth year, that would have been your sixth year. I overheard her talking with Ginny Weasley one night in the common room about how you were… sort of fit. I remember her talking about your hair.”</p><p>I had to admit, if I were to choose a good personal feature, it would be my hair. White blond is rather striking.</p><p>“Did she like my hair?”</p><p>Owen looked uncomfortable at the line of questioning. “I guess?”</p><p>Well, in for a knut, in for a galleon. “And, did she say she thought I was definitely fit, or sort of fit?”</p><p>“I don't… know? Fit, I guess.” Owen’s look of distressed confusion was heightened by the amused grins of the other Gryffindor wizards.</p><p>“You got a thing for Hermione Granger, Malfoy? Yeah, I can sorta see that,” the older Potter chuckled, taking out a little silver orb from his pocket, pressing a button and flipping it up. “I've got to text this to Dean, he will die.”</p><p>“Put away your muggle telephone, Potter. I was just curious,” I said brusquely. “I need to hit the john.”</p><p>I pushed through the smattering of talkative trivia contestants to the toilets, and re-emerged a moment later into a raucous nightclub atmosphere, hazy with cigar smoke. The electronic dance music was so loud that my teeth rattled.</p><p>I made a lap around the room, noticing a handful of Holyhead Harpies and a few higher ups in the British Quidditch league already milling about in the crowd. No sign yet of the Weaselette or Hermione.</p><p>At the bar, I downed a quick fire whiskey for courage and checked my watch. 8:03.</p><p>Just then, a door from the back of the pub opened and the two of them emerged. This made sense; they would have used the private floo back in the business offices rather than the public one, which required age and identification verification before you could come through, and likely involved a wait on busy nights.</p><p>She looked delectable. Tonight she was dressed in a tight pair of satiny black pants that stopped just below the knee. Her tall black heels showed off her legs perfectly, and the purple silky blouse dipped low in the back, exposing a creamy swath of skin, complimented by a jeweled necklace that hung down her back.</p><p>Ginny and Hermione made quick work of greeting everyone, going around the room to make their presence known. The Weaselette seemed to be dragging Hermione from group to group. She looked more and more bored as the minutes ticked by.</p><p>When they finally reached the bar just down from me, it was 8:20 and Hermione looked thoroughly done with the smoke and music. She waved a hand in front of her face and took a small sip of the fruity concoction whipped up for her by the barkeep.</p><p>I had only seconds; behind her, I could see a tall wizard making his way towards her, a hungry gleam in his eye. I stepped quickly to her side and bumped into her shoulder.</p><p>She turned to me in surprise, a fast, involuntary smile playing across her face. “Oh! Malfoy! I wasn't expecting to see you here!”</p><p>“Hermione Granger. How wonderful to see you. How have you been?”</p><p>She laughed a bit, waving again at the smoke in front of her face. The tall wizard veered off glumly.</p><p>“In life in general, or just tonight?” She asked.</p><p>“Life in general.”</p><p>“Quite well, thanks. And you?”</p><p>“Great,” I said, then took a deep breath. “In general, I mean, although I have to say, right now the smoke is kind of getting to me.”</p><p>She looked at me appraisingly and I carded my fingers through my hair in what I hope looks rakishly handsome and not at all nervous.</p><p>“I think there is a smoke free room in the back, if you'd like? It's usually not too crowded, I might go check it out as well.”</p><p>I didn't want to take the chance of Dimitri also finding the smoke to be too much.</p><p>“How about dinner instead?” I asked with a smirk. “I am famished.”</p><p>And I actually was. The salt and vinegar crisps from Flourish and Blotts, and the handful of cheese and bacon chips had done nothing to sate my appetite.</p><p>“I don't know… I'm not sure if Ginny…”</p><p>We spotted the bright red headed witch quickly. She was dancing with her arse pushed into the groin of a dark blond wizard, her arms wrapped around a dark-haired witch. The two were French kissing and rubbing each other.</p><p>“She seems fine,” I offered, and Hermione turned to look at me with an almost comical look of shock. “Come on, Granger. Go out to dinner with me, I'll buy you ten amazing starters before the meal.”</p><p>The look of shock turned to one of amusement. “Ten starters? And pudding?”</p><p>“Fifteen puddings.”</p><p>She pretended to consider for a moment, then smiled. “Okay.”</p><p>She summoned her cloak from the back offices and we moved towards the exit floo. Just as we were stepping up to leave, the entrance floo roared to life and Viktor Krum and Dimitri shouldered their way out.</p><p>“Oh! Viktor! It's been so long since I've seen you, how have you been?” Hermione moved towards them, and my stomach clenched.</p><p>“Good to see you, Herminny.” Viktor gave her a small side hug and gesture to Dimitri. “My friend, Dimitri. This is Herminny, we meet years ago at the Triwizard tournament at Hogwarts.”</p><p>“Good meet you,” Dimitri's eyes raked over her appreciatively.</p><p>I stepped up next to her. “Granger, we should hurry, they might run out of chocolate gateau.”</p><p>She looked at me and pursed her lips, trying to not laugh. “You're right, Malfoy.” She turned back to the two burly wizards. “You two have a great night.”</p><p>We moved back to the exit floo. “That Dominic fellow seems like a man of few words,” I ventured, purposefully mixing up his name.</p><p>She gave me a dazzling smile. “He is, isn't he?”</p><p>Laughing together, we stepped into the floo and emerged from an enchanted doorway onto Derby Square.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Dinner went perfectly, if possible even better than the one at Noir because I could look her in the eye and was using her correct name. We flooed from the enchanted doorway back to the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>“Walk me home?” she asked.</p><p>I recognized her offer as a chance to spend more time together, rather than her flooing directly to her flat alone.</p><p>The easy conversation continued all the way to her flat as we walked the streets of muggle London.</p><p>“This is me,” she said, stopping at the bright orange door of a trendy walk-up.</p><p>She turned to stand in front of me, and my heart started racing suddenly. Without thinking, I lifted my hands to her face, my fingers brushing her cheeks and pushing back lightly on her tumultuous curls. She parted her lips in a small gasp and without a second thought, I tilted my head down and covered her lips with mine.</p><p>She pushed her lips lightly back into mine, then sucked my lower lip into her mouth. My body stirred against hers as our hips met. She wrapped her arms around my waist and tugged me even closer, pushing herself against the outline of my cock, which, despite my best efforts to the contrary, was coming alive.</p><p>She pulled back slightly. “Come in for one last drink?”</p><p>As we make our way up the stairs, me a few steps behind her, my mouth was both dry and watering too much. I'd only been in a flat alone with four women, and one was my sister.</p><p>Hermione tapped her wand to the door. She turned to me, meeting my eyes.</p><p>“I'm going to go into my bedroom and put on my new pyjamas. And then you can come in and take them off of me.”</p><p>She disappeared into a back room with a smile back at me and I tried to maintain my cool.</p><p>Shoes and cloak off, shirt unbuttoned a bit, yes. Spearmint lozenge, check.</p><p>Fresh smelling underwear and socks? Done.</p><p>I found a mirror. My hair was doing its level best to look disheveled. I fixed it as best I could.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>I stepped into the small bedroom, my gaze transfixed on Hermione, seated on the bed in an adorable pair of green pyjamas with little pink flowers all over them.</p><p>I instantly tripped over her black heels and trousers, left in the middle of the room. Fuck.</p><p>Back upright, I continued more carefully. I sat next to her gingerly, and both of us surged forward at the same time, clacking our teeth together. Two embarrassed apologies later, we tried again, more successfully this time.</p><p>After getting her shirt off, I fumbled with her bra for a good 30 seconds before she politely stopped me and told me that it unlatched in the front.</p><p>We both managed to get our trousers off without too much bumbling, but I stuttered on the contraception charm and she winced a bit, then did it herself as an extra precaution.</p><p>Her body was fucking beautiful. I knew my eyes likely looked a bit insane as they roved over her, trying to take in every single detail like I was told to memorize it. She was soft everywhere she was supposed to be, wet and warm in ways that I had only dreamed of. My fumbling experiences with a handful of other women had not prepared me for the explosion of desire and adoration I felt for this witch.</p><p>Unfortunately, it didn't last nearly long enough. Barely two minutes after we started, I felt my climax coming on. Noooo. This was far too soon. I managed to hold off another ninety seconds, but the feel of her walls dragging against my cock was just far too much, and I couldn't stop.</p><p>We laid back on the bed, side by side, not looking at each other, hands clasped. “Was it good?” I asked stupidly.</p><p>“It was,” she said in a tone that sounded as though she was trying to convince herself. “I liked it.”</p><p>This would not do. “I can do better. Hold on just a minute.” I went back to the living room in search of a cupboard.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>This time, when she disappeared into the bedroom, I tried to calm down and take some deep breaths. I mentally reviewed the sex checklist that Theo had always sworn by. Mouth, Neck, Tits, Cunt. With your mouth, in that order. In my haste to have sex, I had completely forgotten the warm-up act.</p><p>I strolled casually into the bedroom, picking up and moving her shoes and trousers so as not to trip. I sat down  on the bed and when she surged forward, I held back. I casted the contraception charm perfectly, and had her bra off in three seconds.</p><p>“Wow, you really know your way around lingerie. Most of the time, no one recognizes a front latch.”</p><p>“Well, I try to be observant,” I murmured softly into her neck. After a bit of lingering there, I worked my way down, taking a soft pink nipple into my mouth and working over it with my tongue. She was moaning now, but I was laser focused. I would not be playing another 2 minute match.</p><p>I worked my way down her body, stopping when I get to her stomach. “Is this all right?” I asked.</p><p>“Gods, yes!” She answered enthusiastically.</p><p>As I kissed and licked her body, I listened for her moans, and likewise her moments of quiet. “Any feedback for the class?” I asked teasingly.</p><p>“No teeth,” she said. “Ever. And don't just focus on my clit, go up and down, go around it sometimes. And– is this too much? Am I being bossy?”</p><p>“Gods, no, I love it,” I moaned. “Please tell me more. And what?”</p><p>“Try and make your tongue flatter, but soft. Not so pointy. Unless you're going inside, then maybe pointy,” she finished, both blushing in embarrassment and bucking up off the bed in pleasure.</p><p>I groaned deeply, once again reminding myself to calm down, that I would not be running a two-minute drill here.</p><p>“Oh, oh, I love that. Make that noise again.”</p><p>This time, I lasted for six minutes, and she screamed my name as she came.</p><p>But I could do better.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>This time, I fairly jogged across the room, vaulting myself over her shoes. I pushed her lightly back on the bed and we kissed hungrily for a minute before I buried my face in her cleavage, snapping the bra open with my teeth.</p><p>“Oh! Oh my gods, Draco!”</p><p>We were undressed in seconds, and I repeated my path down her body, voraciously licking and sucking, until I got to her mouth wateringly spellbinding cunt. I buried my face in it gently, following her instructions to the letter.</p><p>“Oh my gods, You're amazing at this. How are you so good at this? Gods you could do this to me for hours,” she moaned, and I growled softly into her.</p><p>“Draco! Draco! Fuck!” She shrieked, shattering around my tongue. Fuck, yes.</p><p>I used my fingers next, and was on firmer footing– this, at least, I had it on good authority that I was good at. I can still remember Hannah drunkenly telling me on the New Year's before last about how much she appreciated my long fingers, and giving instructions on where to touch.</p><p>Hermione seemed to agree, although most of her words were gibberish and some variation of my name and ‘fuck.’</p><p>This time, when I entered her, I took my time, rolling my hips slowly. After a few minutes, I held her tightly to me and rolled over, allowing her to take over. The sight of her on top of me, taking her pleasure from me, was breathtaking.</p><p>Five minutes later, I lifted her off and set her down on the bed next to me on her knees, coming up behind her to go for round three. I reached around her and softly pressed on her clit as I pumped into her, my hips snapping against her luscious bum. She screamed out her third orgasm. I didn't keep track of the time this time, but I knew it was long enough.</p><p>When we were done, we both lay boneless and out of breath on the bed, and I felt myself falling asleep within seconds.</p><p>“Oh my gods, Draco. Best night of my entire life.”</p><p>Dimly, half awake, I registered that she had been calling me Draco ever since I'd entered the bedroom, and I vowed then and there to never go back to Malfoy in her mouth again. I love the sound of Draco on her lips far too much.</p><p>“Mine too, Hermione,” I answered, trying to sound of her name in my mouth and finding that I loved it just as much. “And now I think I'm about to have the best sleep of my entire life.”</p><p>“So once is enough for my perfect Slytherin?” Hermione asked teasingly.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Within a few weeks, I was only going back to Severus's house occasionally to pick up more clothes to bring back to Hermione's flat.</p><p>Within a month, I found myself attending couples brunches and strolling through Saturday morning markets in search of the perfect strawberries to recreate Hermione's mother’s strawberry shortcake.</p><p>Within two months, I was using the word we instead of I. As in, yes, we watched that program the other night. Or no, we don't really care for mushrooms on pizza. Or, we've switched our cat to all-natural cat food, and he really seems to like it better. I only saw Severus on occasion, for example when we had him and the leading lady, Hestia, over for dinner.</p><p>Within six months, I couldn't imagine living life without Hermione.</p><p>Two weeks later, I came downstairs for breakfast to find her frantically throwing things into a laundry hamper, her eyes a bit wild.</p><p>“Sweet? Everything all right?” I asked cautiously.</p><p>“Fine! Fine. Just fine. It's just - My parents are on their way. They usually say they're coming but they get busy and decide not to, but this time they're actually coming.”</p><p>“Your parents?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“To this flat?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And…Do they know about me?”</p><p>“They know about…The idea of you.”</p><p>“And…does the idea of me - live here?” I asked, seeing as everything in the hamper belonged to me.</p><p>“Um–” her voice went up an octave. This was clearly a subject that had not been broached with the elder Grangers. “Yes. You live here.”</p><p>“Right. Okay.” I said. “Well, that's good. And do we have sex?” I asked.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at me. “Yes, Draco, we have sex. But - not oral.”</p><p>“Hermione, how would that even come up?”</p><p>“I don't know, but if it does–”</p><p>“Brilliant. Okay, no oral sex.”</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>“Oh, fuck. They're already here!” she cried, sprinting first to the bedroom with the hamper, tossing it inside and closing the door, then sprinting back to me. “Okay. Your name is Draco and you're my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Wait, are we getting our stories straight? Because that's all true.”</p><p>“Right. Okay let's do this.”</p><p>She huffed out a breath and opened the door on a well dressed, proper looking couple in their fifties.</p><p>“Mum! Dad! So glad you're here!” Hermione gestured awkwardly to me. “This is Draco. He's– my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Oh, darling, we didn't mean to disturb you whilst you were entertaining guests. We can come back.” Linda Granger said politely.</p><p>“Ah, no– Mum– I'm not entertaining guests. Draco… lives here.”</p><p>“Oh,” said Stephen Granger, and his tone was far less polite. Both their faces, in fact, looked rather drawn all of a sudden.</p><p>“But we don't have oral sex,” I said magnanimously, offering them my most winning smile.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Ten minutes later, we sat down to the most awkward brunch in the history of brunches.</p><p>“So, Draco, what do you do?” Stephen began the interrogation. I started to speak, but Hermione cut me off.</p><p>“He's a most wonderful barrister, Daddy. He's really quite brilliant, he hasn't lost a case yet.”</p><p>“How interesting. And did you know Hermione at her school or did you meet–?” Linda asked.</p><p>I recognized this as a question of if I am a wizard. I began to reply when Hermione did it for me.</p><p>“Yes, we met at Hogwarts. Draco was near the top of our class, he’s very smart.”</p><p>I was a bit surprised that she knew that, and almost saif so, but it was back to Stephen again.</p><p>“And are you a muggle-born as well, Draco, or are your parents wizarding folk?”</p><p>I didn't even bother to pretend to speak, knowing my witch would field this one. “Draco is a pure blood, Daddy. Both sides of his family are within the Sacred 28.”</p><p>Linda asked, “And are you allowed to speak, Draco, or does Hermione do all of your talking?”</p><p>Everyone at the table except for Hermione laughed, and she answered, “of course he's able to speak!”</p><center>

</center><p>Sev’s girlfriend Hestia was set to star in a new play in the West End. He reserved us two tickets for the second weekend after opening, but Hermione wasn't interested in joining me. I offered it to Theo, who laughed in my face. So I offered it to Ernie, who was happy to have something to do on a Friday night.</p><p>The play ended and as we gathered our things, a flash of honey blonde hair caught my attention.</p><p>“Huh. Remember me telling you about the girl I was hung up on the summer before I started at the firm? That's her.”</p><p>“Which one? The short one next to Astoria Greengrass?”</p><p>“No– it was Astoria Greengrass.”</p><p>Ernie laughed, saw my face, and said, “oh you're serious. Wait, you really thought you had a chance with Astoria Greengrass?”</p><p>“Why not?” I said, a bit annoyed. “What's wrong with me?”</p><p>“Nothing's wrong with you, mate. I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat. But Astoria is in a whole different league. I once overheard Zabini say that he would drink her bathwater if given half a chance.”</p><p>“Well, Blaise was always kind of a sick fuck.”</p><p>“He said it to you, and you agreed with him.”</p><p>“Well, I was a sick fuck too. Come on, maybe she won't see us.”</p><p>We were nearly to the doors of the theater when I heard her call my name.</p><p>“Astoria! Hello! So great to see you.”</p><p>“I thought the two of you saw me inside, but I guess not,” said Astoria, flashing us a perfect smile. “This is my girlfriend, Emma.”</p><p>“Your girlfriend? Oh! Well, that explains so much, I suppose.”</p><p>The two women fixed me with a quizzical look. “What do you mean?” asked Astoria.</p><p>“Just the whole gay thing,” I said. ”I guess it never occurred to me...”</p><p>She gave me a hateful look. “I'm not gay. You know girlfriend can mean just a friend who's a girl, right?”</p><p>“Right, of course. Would you excuse me a moment? Just need to visit the loo.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“This is my girlfriend, Emma.”</p><p>“Oh! Very pleased to meet you, Emma,” I answered. “Just for your own information, Astoria, sometimes when people use the word girlfriend, people might make assumptions, you know…” I tilted my hand back and forth in a teetering motion.</p><p>“No, what sort of assumption?” She gave me a sharp look.</p><p>“That you might– be– gay.”</p><p>“I am gay,” said Emma accusingly.</p><p>“Would you excuse me for a moment? Just need to visit the loo.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“This is my girlfriend, Emma.”</p><p>“Pleased to meet you, Emma. This is my friend Ernie.”</p><p>Ernie piped up, “you know, you should be careful introducing friend as girlfr–”</p><p>‘Shut up,” I said pleadingly to him.</p><p>“It's so good to see you, Draco. You're looking great,” Astoria said warmly.</p><p>“Thanks, you too.” And she did. Back at the manor in Wiltshire, there had been no need for tight black dresses and tall stiletto heels, but they suited her well</p><p>She smiled and dipped her gaze, then looked back up at me. “We were just heading to dinner so I guess we'll see you…”</p><p>“Yes, brilliant. See you another time.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“Wow, I can't believe she actually followed you out of the theater to talk to you,” Ernie said, a bit awestruck.</p><p>“Yeah, but notice how she didn't give me the time of day. It's just as well– I'm not–”</p><p>‘Draco!” A familiar voice called. Astoria ran towards us, hair flying wildly about.</p><p>“I told Emma to go ahead, I'll catch up with her on a different night. Would you like to grab a bite?”</p><p>“Er–”</p><p>“I've got to get going, Draco. See you at work Monday?” Ernie gave me a significant look.</p><p>I shook my head frantically behind Astoria's back, but Ernie only waggled his brows.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Dinner was surprisingly nice. Astoria was friendly and personable, not at all flirtatious. She accidentally brushed my arm a couple of times, but apologized immediately afterwards. I told her it was all right. Her leg also rubbed against mine once, but she laughed that it was such a small table and my legs were so long, it was difficult not to bump into them.</p><p>When we'd finished, I was ready to head home via floo. But Astoria said her floo at home wasn't working properly, and she didn't really care for apparition. Would I mind side along apparating with her back to her flat? I was happy to oblige, anything for a friend.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>As soon as we were inside her flat, Astoria removed her shoes and cloak.</p><p>“Gods, I am exhausted. And I'm so tired of wearing this– “ At these words, she tapped her wand at her neckline and her dress unzipped, falling to the floor. Under the dress was a skimpy pair of blue thong knickers– and nothing else.</p><p>“Er–” I said eloquently, my words failing me.</p><p>“Would you like to get more comfortable, Draco?” She cooed, reaching over to grab my tie and pull me closer.</p><p>Oh. <em>Oh.</em> Well, this was all highly unexpected, I thought.</p><p>‘Oof, Astoria, I'm sorry - I just realized that I need to be somewhere. Have a good night.”</p><p>I did have somewhere to be– and that place was in the arms of the witch I loved and wanted to spend my life with.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Hermione was asleep in our room, hot chocolate gone cold on the bedside table, a stack of books next to her on the bed and another book open on her chest. Crookshanks, curled in a ball against her side, cracked one eye and stared at me imperiously, as if to say, ‘Leave us.’</p><p>“Hermione– love? Wake up.” I sst next to her on the bed and pulled her sleeping body into my arms, kissing her on her cheek.</p><p>“Nnhhngh. Sleepin.”</p><p>“Wake up.. I– I love you. Let's get married.”</p><p>“Shh. Sleeping.”</p><p>Hmm. That didn't go well. Time to redo it.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I called Ernie, who was the only person I knew that owned and knew how to play an instrument, and also would answer the floo and come to my flat at midnight, no questions asked. His elderly neighbors, Amelia and Archie, heard him setting off and stopped him, asking where he was headed at this late hour. It turned out, Archie played the violin and Amelia, the handheld harp, so they joined him.</p><p>I dug out every candle we owned, which turned out to be quite a lot for such a small flat. After lighting them, I stationed Ernie and his improvised band in the living room to play music on his clarinet and try it again.</p><p>“Darling? Pet, can you wake up? Please? Come and have a chat with me.”</p><p>“Nnhhngh. Sleepin.”</p><p>“Hermione, love. Can you please wake up? I have an important question for you.”</p><p>“Can't it wait ‘til morning? I was having the loveliest dream.” She yawned hugely without opening her eyes and sat up, swaying a bit. “What's that music? Why is the wireless on?”</p><p>“It's got to do with what I want to ask you.”</p><p>Her eyes were open now, and she blinked a few times to focus on me blearily.</p><p>“Wait a minute,” she said. “Romantic music. Guy with an important question. Are you on one knee?”</p><p>Her eyes dropped to the floor to confirm.</p><p>“On one knee.”</p><p>“Hmm,” I hummed.</p><p>“Were you so bored at the theater that you had to rush home to ask me to marry you?” She smiled hugely.</p><p>“Something like that. So, will you, in fact, marry me? Any thoughts on your answer? Yes, no, leave me alone, loser? All of those answers are in the mix right now,” I said jokingly, to cover up my anxiety.</p><p>She dipped her head down to me, still kneeling on the floor, kissing me deeply. “Yes. I would love to marry you. Thank you for asking me.”</p><p>“Thank you for saying yes,” I said with a sigh of relief.</p><p>“And thank you for not doing it with a ton of people around. It always seems so embarrassing. I think proposals should be private, just the two of you.”</p><p>“I quite agree. Just let me go and turn off the wireless and make sure I warded the front door,” I said, pushing myself up from kneeling and laying her back on the bed, tucking her under the covers.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I had put off the inevitable long enough. Now that Hermione and I were engaged, there was nothing for it but to introduce her to my family.</p><p>We stood in our tiny living room, and I offered last minute instructions.</p><p>“My father will try to draw you into a discussion about books. Resist that. And if Cousin Regulus asks you anything, just smile and nod.”</p><p>“Right. No books.”</p><p>“And if my mother offers you tea, turn it down.”</p><p>“No tea.”</p><p>“Okay. Ready?” She nodded, and I dropped a pinch of green powder into the flames of the tiny fireplace. “Malfoy Manor!”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>My mother was in the floo parlor to welcome us. She had barely a glance for me, instead hurrying to Hermione to offer her a hug and kiss on the cheek.</p><p>“Welcome! Welcome, Hermione. We're so glad that Draco finally decided to share you with us. Merlin, you are pretty.”</p><p>Hermione blushed furiously. “No, it's just glamour charms.”</p><p>“Hmm.” My mother looked at her critically. “No, I don't think so. Even without all that lipstick, you would be breathtaking. Tea?”</p><p>“I'd love some,” said the traitorous Hermione.</p><p>“Well, that's the afternoon lost,” I said, to no one in particular because the two women had left me alone, heading for the conservatory.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I found Pansy in the family room, to my surprise.</p><p>I didn't expect you to be here, Pans,” I said, leaning over the back of the sofa to plant a kiss on her hair.</p><p>“Just the last couple of weeks,” she said, the huge smile of greeting she had offered me faltering slightly.</p><p>“How is London treating you?” I asked, though the real question was hidden inside my words. <em>How is Zacharias treating you?</em></p><p>“Not so great. Rather horrid, actually.”</p><p>I wish I could say I was surprised. I had only had a few classes over the years with Zacharias Smith at Hogwarts, but none of my experiences with him had been good. His work had been perpetually late and sloppy, and the rumors of his drug use had begun as early as third year. Pansy had not had the misfortune to take any classes with him, and she seldom listened to rumors or gossip.</p><p>“I'm sorry,” is all that I said.</p><p>“Is Hermione here?”</p><p>“In the conservatory.”</p><p>Without another word, Pansy leaped from the sofa, flinging her magazine to the ground and running in that direction, singing Hermione's name off key the whole way.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The whole family joined for tea, during which everyone who wasn't already in love with Hermione fell in love with her.</p><p>I accompanied Father to his study for a quick game of Wizarding Skittles before supper. He flipped through records to play on his Victrola.</p><p>“What do you think of Hermione?”</p><p>“She's brilliant, I like her more than you already.”</p><p>“Yes, you're not alone in that.”</p><p>“Oh, look, I'd forgotten this.” Father removed a record from its sleeve, cranking the victrola vigorously. The opening strains of Iko Iko flood the room.</p><p>“Ah yes,” I said. “The Dixie Cups. The best girl group of the twentieth century. They were able to do with three what the Spice Girls needed five to accomplish.”</p><p>“And just look at these gams!”</p><p>“Truly excellent,” I agreed. I gestured to the skittles board. “Are we playing, or…?”</p><p>“Ah, yes!” Father grabbed the spinning top and readied himself theatrically. “Ahhhhh! The crowd cheers wildly as the first openly blond father/son duo of the modern era prepare to battle on the skittles pitch. The father readies his spin as his son looks on fearfully, and the son already smells defeat…”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>We sat down to dinner in the garden, as the weather was nice. The conversation was flowing. Mum and Pansy were critiquing some muggle artist named Pollock. Father and I talked about Severus's latest play, and how talented the leading lady was. Hermione had engaged Cousin Regulus in a discussion about tea cozies. I tapped my knife lightly on the side of my crystal goblet and cleared my throat.</p><p>“We have decided, after a bit of time together, that we are getting married,” I said to my family a bit nervously.</p><p>There was a gasp and shout of happy surprise and congratulations.</p><p>This was broken by Cousin Regulus, who asked me, “Who are you getting married to?”</p><p>“To Hermione.”</p><p>“Oh! Right, good. It would've been jolly embarrassing if it had been another girl.”</p><p>“Quite,” I smiled fondly at him. “And I must say, we are going to do this sooner rather than later, because we are also expecting a baby.”</p><p>The cheers and screams redoubled. Over the din, Cousin Regulus asked Hermione, “and who is the baby's father?”</p><p>“It's Draco.”</p><p>“Ah. Jolly good. Would have been rather awkward if you'd said another man.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Back in our small flat, I pointed my wand at our muggle television to change the channel. It was true that our wands were not as effective as the television remote, but we were constantly losing it.</p><p>Hermione came in from the bedroom, dressed in her favorite pyjamas.</p><p>“The waistband on these trousers are getting tight,” she announced, as though this were a significant event.</p><p>“All right…? Are you not a witch? Just make it larger,” I pointed out, but I could tell from her face that I had missed the point.</p><p>“This baby is coming soon.”</p><p>I looked up at her in alarm. “Didn't you say you think you're only a couple of months?"</p><p>“You know what I mean. The point is, we've got to decide some things about this wedding, and we're deciding tonight. The only decision you have made so far is that I will walk up the aisle to some ridiculous old song called Iko Iko.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“A decision that I vetoed immediately.”</p><p>“Right.’</p><p>“To that end, I will vanish one article of clothing for every decision we make tonight.”</p><p>“Oh! Well, I like this game.”</p><p>“Okay! Where do you want to get married?”</p><p>“The Manor, perhaps down at the lake?”</p><p>“Lovely!” She vanished her pyjama blouse. “And who should officiate the ceremony?”</p><p>“Um… Well I think we can agree on this one fairly easily. When I think of weddings, I only want the best officiant.”</p><p>“That's a lock for Hagrid, then.” We both laughed a bit. During our time at Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall married a former classmate of hers, Ludo Bagman. They were polar opposites, but both heartily enjoyed Quidditch and Transfigurations so much that they never seemed to run out of topics of conversation.</p><p>They were married at the end of our 5th year, and the students were invited to attend. Hagrid officiated, and blubbered more than anyone else at the wedding, including the bride, who did not blubber at all.</p><p>“All right, officiant chosen.” Hermione vanished her socks. Well, that was a bit disappointing. “Okay, how about best man?”</p><p>“Oooh. Ah. This one is difficult. Theo is my best friend, but…”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“He's such a wanker. He'll fuck it all up.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“So, Ernie.”</p><p>“Right,” she reached behind her back for her bra clasp.</p><p>“No, Severus.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“No, Ernie.”</p><p>“Let's just circle back. Honeymoon?” she reached for her apparently straining waistband, which looked much the same to me.</p><p>“Um. France? My family has a small chateau there.”</p><p>“I'm not taking off my trousers for a crumbly old barn in France.”</p><p>“Okay. Sardinia.”</p><p>“Better. What else do you have?”</p><p>“Take off your pants!” The waistband did not budge. “Er– Okinawa? Or Fiji?”</p><p>“That's better! Why not both?” She took off her pajama pants and knickers together.</p><p>“Yes, let's do both,” I said enthusiastically, shucking my own trousers and pants quickly.</p><p>She straddled me on the sofa, and began kissing my neck, rubbing her slightly swollen tits against my chest.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, I was rock hard and ready and Hermione lifted up, impaling herself on my cock.</p><p>“Best decision making session you've ever had, love,” she managed to moan out between her mewls of delight.</p><p>I leaned her back to get a better angle, bracing her with one hand whilst the other rubbed gently at her clit and my teeth nibbling softly at her neck.</p><p>“Hmm, You're right. This is the best decision I've ever made.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The wedding day dawned overcast, with a temperate fog that hovered over the valley. I stood down by the lake, thankful for the weather charms that kept everyone dry and not too windswept. I fiddled a bit with the cufflinks of my so dark-green-they-were-nearly-black dress robes. When Hermione suggested the color, I was amenable. It felt a little odd, like I was back in my Slytherin days, but green was her favorite color.</p><p>Behind me, standing under the stone arch, Hagrid sobbed and blew his nose into a large handkerchief. I stifled a chuckle. Hagrid was always good value and could be counted on for exactly this.</p><p>“Not a great day for it, eh?” Ernie dug an elbow into my side. I narrowed my eyes at him.</p><p>A drum beat began in the distance, quickly accompanying by finger snaps and clapping. I tilted my head in curiosity.</p><p>
  <em>“My grandma and your grandma<br />
Were sittin' by the fire<br />
My grandma told your grandma<br />
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire” </em>
</p><p>A broad grin spread upon my face.</p><p>Ginny Weasley sashayed down the aisle, giving me a lurid wink as she passed and went to stand on the far side of the arch.</p><p>The audience stood, Linda Granger looking appropriately scandalized at the musical choice. The standing throng obscured my view of Hermione. I suddenly wished that she'd come in on a broom.</p><p>Then she rounded the corner on the arm of her father and my breath caught.</p><p>She was fucking beautiful. Her hair, half up and half down, fell over her bare shoulders. A delicate lace bodice in a golden cream color finished in a flowing silk skirt. Her bouquet of gardenias, daisies, and vincas obscured the barely-there baby bump that she was a little self-conscious about, this being a proper wedding and all.</p><p>But the look on her gorgeous face as she swayed down the aisle… I knew I would never forget it. The raised eyebrow, to come-hither stare, the luxuriant smile… and then her mouth begin to move along with the words of the song.</p><p>
  <em>See that guy all dressed in green?<br />
Iko, iko, un-day<br />
He's not a man,<br />
he's a lovin' machine<br />
Jock-a mo fee na-né </em>
</p><p>She was perfect.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>It was time for the toasts.</p><p>Ginny went first. “Draco was a bit of a tosser back in school. Hermione was far out of his league then. Us Gryffindors beat his Slytherins nearly every year he played in Quidditch, and I only wish that I've been able to see his most glorious moment– the five minutes he spent as a white ferret, courtesy of my brother. But, I think the fact that he is great enough to have stolen the heart of one of the smartest Gryffindors that ever lived more than makes up for all that. To Draco and Hermione!”</p><p>Next up was Ernie. “when Draco told me that I would need to make a speech, at his wedding, I thought, what makes a couple? Clearly, it's chemistry. Libacious Borridge, the author of Advanced Potion Making, defines chemistry as the combination of two or more elements, producing a chemical conglomerate different than the sum of the elements themselves. Now, to put that in layman's terms, let's look at the formula for the wolfsbane potion…”</p><p>By the time he was done, I counted four people falling asleep. A small child was crying inconsolably a few tables away, and I had the feeling that there were fully grown adults who would do the same if they were able to. Hermione fixed me with a look I recognized as a recent addition to her repertoire. It said ‘I have to pee, please help me disentangle myself from this situation post haste.’</p><p>“Would you excuse me a minute, darling? I just need to take care of something,” I said, hurrying into the house to find the nearest cupboard.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Ginny finished her speech once more, and Severus rose, his hair falling into his eyes darkly.</p><p>“Draco Malfoy lived in my house, ate my food, and disturbed my sex life for nearly eight months. And yet in all of that time, he never learned one very. Basic. Fact. About. Me. I DO NOT WRITE FOR FREE. You have asked me to put quill to parchment and pound out a sentimental note, and never offered me a knut–”</p><p>“Sorry, just– Can everyone give me a minute?</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Ginny finished her speech for the third time, and Theo stood up.</p><p>“Back in school, Draco was rather uninformed about the ladies. Let's take a look at his past conquests and missteps.” Theo conjured several large photographs of witches that floated in the air next to him, all framed in differently colored frames.</p><p>“The girls you see in frames of purple, those are the ones that he lusted after but was never able to cash the cheque, if you get my drift. Moving on, the girls you see here with the white frames, those were just heavy snogging, or perhaps a bit of over the shirt action. The yellow framed girls, well, they gave Draco blow jobs. The thicker the frame, the better the blow job was. Now, the greens– well, the green photos are the ladies into which Draco achieved full penetration–”</p><p>I stood up. “I'll be right back,” I muttered before he could explain what the red frames were.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“... And so a toast, to the man with the whitest blond hair and the best bride in the room.” Father raised his glass in our direction and smiled at us fondly. “Ladies and gentlemen, Draco and Hermione!”</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Later, as the guests were all dancing and dining, Father said to me, “I wish I had told you that I loved you.”</p><p>“You did. You have.”</p><p>“I mean in the speech. Hold on; I'll be right back,” and he started towards the door.</p><p>“It's all right,” I called.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“... Later on, I may tell you of Draco's many failings, either as a wizard or as a skittles champion,” Father said, to a general tittering about the room. “But I just want to say one last thing. I have loved three men in my life.</p><p>Some of you know, my father was a arse, so that leaves him out. The other two are Cousin Regulus here, Frank Sinatra, obviously.... And my son, Draco.</p><p>“I'd only give a few piece of advice to anyone marrying. Treat each other every bit of kindness that you can muster. Talk to each other about everything. And be proud of each other and the life you're building together.” Father paused here.</p><p>“I'm not particularly proud of everything I've done in my life, but I am very proud to be the father of my son, and the father-in-law of Hermione. To Draco and Hermione!”</p><p>We danced and drank and ate everything. Ernie took a chance with hitting on Astoria and was shot down immediately. But later in the evening, he was snogging the tonsils out of one of Hermione's old roommates at Hogwarts, Parvati. Theo and Ginny snuck off for another tryst and were back a little while later.. I saw Astoria getting in a muggle car with Ron Weasley to leave.</p><p>I was dancing with Pansy when Cousin Regulus approached. “Do you want to cut in?” I asked.</p><p>“No, no; I'll just dance with both of you.” He put one hand on each of our backs and began swaying with us. “Draco, it was lovely, thank you for having me,” he said solemnly.</p><p>“Well, Cousin Regulus– You live here. But I would have invited you anyway.”</p><p>“And I appreciate that. Pancake, you'll be next.”</p><p>“I'm not so sure, Cousin Regulus. Boys are not always nice.”</p><p>I looked over to where Zacharias was sitting. He looked sullen and angry about something. He checked his watch and blew his breath out in annoyance, then drained his fire whiskey.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The baby was born, and he was simply perfect. Everyone thought so.</p><p>My family visited us in St. Mungo's the night Hermione delivered him.</p><p>Father and Mum doted on him and Hermione, and mostly ignored me, but that was expected.</p><p>“Oh, he's beautiful. I can tell, he's got lots of bright magic. Do you think he would levitate if I tossed him in the air?” Cousin Regulus asked seriously, reaching to hold Leo.</p><p>“Let's not find out,” Hermione said kindly.</p><p>Pansy laughed and cooed, “He can do anything he puts his mind to, can't he? He could probably fly, can't you Leo?”</p><p>I made a mental note to never leave either of them alone with the baby.</p><p>Nothing can prepare you for the love you feel for your baby. Leo was adorable and perfect, with his mother's eyes and curls, and my white blond hair. He smiled and made funny noises, and was our entertainment for large stretches of time, much to the consternation of our childless friends who wanted very little to do with him.</p><p>Nothing can also prepare you for how quickly you have to move to a larger place to accommodate all the shit that babies come with.</p><p>We found a lovely four bedroom three storey brownstone that Hermione worried we could not afford, even though I told her that my vault at Gringotts had plenty of galleons in it.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>In what felt like the blink of an eye, it was already Leo's first birthday. Both families and all of our friends came over to celebrate.</p><p>“Have you heard from Pansy?” Hermione asked about an hour after the party began. “I thought she would be here by now. I got purple cauldron cakes just for her– I knew Leo didn't care, and she loves purple. She's been so down lately, I thought she would enjoy them.”</p><p>“No, I haven't heard from her, come to think of it.” I started into the living room to ask my parents when a soft knock at the door drew me to it. Zacharias stood on the doorstep.</p><p>“Pansy here?” He asked. His sunken eyes were were apparently unable to focus on one place, as they skittered about. He was definitely high on something.</p><p>“No. Wasn't she coming from your flat? Why didn't she floo?” I asked, struggling to tamp down the panic.</p><p>“We were about to leave together, but we had a fight. Pansy said she needed a bit of time to clear her head, so she took her muggle car. She left and told me to meet her here,” he said sullenly.</p><p>“When was this? What route did she take?”</p><p>He looked at me in confusion. “I don't know– I think she usually takes Bagley Road to Cresford. But I always take Pearscroft.”</p><p>“What time? What time did she leave?” I asked frantically.</p><p>“I– I think about thirty minutes ago.” Zacharias’s bloodshot eyes struggled to focus on me properly.</p><p>Fuck. They only lived ten minutes away. I needed to hurry. Severus was just arriving, a pretend potions kit and a stuffed snake under his arm.</p><p>“Sev– gotta run– let Hermione and my parents know I'll be right back.”</p><p>Severus shot me a contemptuous look. “I don't work for you, you know, Draco.”</p><p>“Just fucking do it, arsehole, thanks,” I called back to him, grabbing my keys.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>I was stopped by muggle police, who were blocking Cresford Road ahead. Peering down the street, I could see the smashed front end of Pansy's tiny powder blue Peugeot ahead.</p><p>“The driver of the blue car– is she okay? It's my sister,” I said to the bobby frantically.</p><p>He grimaced. “She's pretty banged up, but they stabilized her. They'll take her to the hospital, get her fixed up. She ran the stop sign, the other driver said she wasn't even looking.”</p><p>I ran back to my car, ignoring the shouts of the police to come back. I just needed more time.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>When I opened my eyes, I was still in the car, parked on the side of road, but there was no police barricade. I checked my watch. Noon – the party began in an hour. I shifted into first, and gunned it up Cresford, stopping carefully before taking a left on Bagley.</p><p>Pansy looked a bit out of it, and like she had been crying when she opened the door, but she seemed happy to see me.</p><p>Back at the house Hermione was charming the napkins to fold and freezing water for iced lemonade. She kissed Pansy on the cheek as Pansy passed through the kitchen in search of baby Leo.</p><p>“I thought Pansy was coming when the party starts? Did you have to go get her?” Hermione asked.</p><p>“Yes… later,” I murmured to her with a significant look as we carried trays of food out to the living room for the guests.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>A few hours later, I was alone with Hermione in the kitchen.</p><p>“What gives? Pansy is acting weird. She's hardly said three words to anyone except Leo. She didn't eat any sandwiches, and she spurned the purple cauldron cakes. And the whole afternoon, we were drinking tea whilst she was drinking wine.” Hermione bit her lip and crossed her arms in worry.</p><p>“Let me talk with her,” I sighed.</p><p>Alone with Pansy in the back garden, I asked how her morning had been before I picked her up.</p><p>“Rough, Dray,” she said, reverting to her childhood nickname for me. “Zach and I went to bed fighting last night. We woke up fighting this morning. We just got back together again last week. Every time we start up again, I think it's going to be different, but it isn't.”</p><p>She laughed humorlessly, taking out her wand to vanish a few weeds that we'd missed. ‘You'd think having a magic wand would make it so that you can wave it and all your problems just go away. But it doesn't work like that, does it? I think every family has a failure, someone that just can't make it properly in life. I think that's me for us.”</p><p>“You're not a failure, Pansy. You've had some stumbles, that's all.” I thought hard about what she said. What if there was a way to make her problems– namely, the albatross, Zacharias–vanish from her life entirely?</p><p>“Can I tell you a secret?”</p><p>She smiled at me.</p><p>“I can travel through time. I can fix this for you. Come with me.”</p><p>I pulled her, laughing, towards me in a hug and placed the destination in my mind: my wardrobe, my childhood bedroom, Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire. We landed with barely a stumble.</p><p>“This is fun,” Pansy said. “When does the time traveling start? Or did it already?” She opened the door a crack but I pulled it shut.</p><p>“Hang on. Hold my hands.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The electronic dance music pumped through the house suddenly, and even in the dark, I could see Pansy's eyes widen slightly. We stepped out of the wardrobe in our party clothes from a couple of years before.</p><p>“Well, this is unexpected.”</p><p>“Quite, the first time,” I agreed, pulling her down the staircase.</p><p>“Heyyyy!” Theo yelled at us. We waved, then proceeded further into the party. There was Zacharias, standing right where she'd first met him years before, still looking caustic and brooding. Pansy started towards his group, but I held her arm. Wait.</p><p>The moment came when they'd met, when she and Tracey and Marietta had approached him and his friends. After a few seconds, Tracey and Marietta approached, and Zacharias's bloodshot eyes lit up. He put his hand on Marietta’s waist and drew her closer, whispering in her ear. She giggled, and turned her face up to his. Within a minute, they were snogging heavily and she was dry humping his leg discretely.</p><p>I looked over at Pansy, who looked shell-shocked. “I'm sorry,” I said.</p><p>“So…if he didn't fall in love with me, he would have just… fallen in love with someone else?” she asked, crestfallen.</p><p>“Some boys don't deserve your love, Pans. You can find someone better.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Ten minutes later, back in the garden behind my brownstone, where my family was helping Hermione clean up from the birthday party, Pansy turned to me suddenly. “Theo!”</p><p>I furrowed my brow at her. “Dodgy Theo?”</p><p>“The someone better!” she answered. “I think- Yes, I think it's been coming on for a while now. Isn't that funny?”</p><p>From inside, I heard the cries of a sleepy just-turned one year old, and I smiled and hurried in, glad to have my family back together as they should have been. I made my way into the den to take Leo for a kip.</p><p>“All right, It sounds like it's time for a new nappy and a little rest for the special birthday–”</p><p>I picked up the baby in the playpen, turning it to face me with dawning horror. “– girl? No, no,” I whispered.</p><p>A beautiful little girl with adorable sandy brown curls gurgled up at me, offering a smile with two tiny little teeth in her bottom gums.</p><p>“Oh! You can take Stella for her new nappy then? Aces, Draco. Love, be sure to change those jam jams before you put her to bed, too– she ate far too much cake in this outfit.” Hermione smiled up at me and kissed me on my lips whilst I stood there, shocked.</p><p>“Actually– I just need to check on something really fast,” I replied, handing her the stranger baby. I needed Leo back. I apparated quickly to St. Mungo's.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“Yes, you can only go back to the moment right before the child is born. Otherwise, whatever baby you've come to know will be different.” Father stood with me inside the cleaning closet on the maternity ward. Across the hall and down a few rooms, Hermione was getting ready to deliver Leo.</p><p>I carded both hands through my hair in distress. “So everything up until today at 6:17pm will stay exactly the same, forever?”</p><p>“Just as it does for everyone else, yes.”</p><p>I straightened up, giving him a hug. “All right. I understand.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Back at the birthday party, I answered the soft knock at the door.</p><p>“Pansy here?”</p><p>“No. Please leave,” I told Zacharias coldly, and closed the front door.</p><p>Behind me, the chime of an incoming floo call sounded. “This is Healer Clearwater at St. Mungo's Hospital. I'm trying to reach the family of Pansy Parkinson Malfoy…”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The five of us sat vigil at her bedside in various rotations for the next three days. Cousin Regulus brought my parents and me and Hermione various combinations of snacks from the cafeteria. My parents would go home to relieve the Grangers from watching Leo, then Hermione and I would go home whilst Mum and Father came back to the hospital.</p><p>The healers had done all they could, but her treatment had been slightly delayed due to the fact that she had been taken to a muggle hospital first. They were waiting for her to come out of sedation before healing all of her cuts and bruises, and she looked, frankly, awful.</p><p>On day three, Pansy woke up. Hermione and I were waiting next to her bed, and we told her what had happened. Thankfully, the family in the other car had no injuries, and with the questionable use of a confundus charm, Father had any charges that Pansy faced dismissed.</p><p>“But… I've got to quit drinking, don't I?”</p><p>“You do,” Hermione answered solemnly.</p><p>“And I need to get rid of Zacharias, right?”</p><p>“You must,” I agreed. “You've got to choose better for yourself. Treat yourself better. Find better friends. You don't by chance remember my friend Theo, do you?”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>We came home to find Ginny Weasley watching Leo.</p><p>“Oh my gods, The two of you have no idea how horrible my night was. This was the absolute worst! I had no idea that taking care of a child was this much work!”</p><p>Ginny continued to rant to herself as she walked out the front door. We laughed to each other in the hallway. I leaned against the wall, spreading my legs and pulling Hermione close to me. I wrapped my arms around her and held the back of her neck, kissing her throat.</p><p>“Let's have another one,” I murmured.</p><p>“Ohh. Noo. That was so much work! And it hurt. And I got fat!”</p><p>“You were gorgeous,” I whispered, nibbling at her ear.</p><p>“No, like really fat. I was a whale!”</p><p>Fortunately, we were young and careless, and usually sleep deprived, so it wasn't long before there were four of us.</p><p>Baby Lyra (I had to veto the name Stella, it brought back such stark memories) was beautiful and giggly. Her dark brown curls and silver eyes could convince anyone of anything, I was certain. She had already convinced me that she was the best thing in the world, alongside her brother and mother.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>“Leo, your sister is taking a nap, and Gammy Lin and Poppy will be here in about an hour. Can you play here in the den for a little while So that Mummy and Daddy can get ready?”</p><p>I'm not sure why I was trying to reason with a two and a half year old. Anyone who has done so will tell you it's a lost cause, but Leo was especially astute, despite his mischievousness.</p><p>“Draco!!” Hermione’s scream from upstairs either meant that there was an intruder, or she was having a fashion emergency. It was a 50/50 toss-up. I took the stairs two at a time.</p><p>“Okay, we're meeting the writer of that manuscript and his wife at Ember and Iron in an hour. I need a dress that says, you can trust me, I'm a good editor. I'm not sleazy or slutty, but I'm also not a prude. Can you help me find that dress?”</p><p>I looked at her. She was wearing a lovely navy blue dress with a wide neck, cut just above the knee. It complimented her wonderfully, and she looked gorgeous.</p><p>“Does this not say all those things?”</p><p>“Draco!” Hermione yelled in frustration.</p><p>“All right, I guess not. What else do you have?”</p><p>She'd already raced into the closet, emerging in a staid beige number that looked like something my grandmother wore to tea in the 1970s.</p><p>“Er–”</p><p>“No, decidedly not,” she said to herself, inspecting the dress in the mirror. “Why do I own this?”</p><p>“For a fancy dress party? Perhaps you're going as Queen Elizabeth?”</p><p>“Right, straight to Oxfam with you,” Hermione vanished the dress, revealing a lovely pink lace bustier attached to her thigh-high stockings with garter belt, along with matching knickers.</p><p>“This looks fabulous,” I said in a deep voice, stepping up behind her and running my hands up her torso, pushing my fingers inside the cups of the bustier to pinch her nipples lightly. “I like this one.”</p><p>She grinds back into me with a tiny moan, and my cock has a hopeful moment, raising his head to check out the situation quickly.</p><p>“No!” She fairly yells, pushing me back. “I've got to choose a dress.”</p><p>“Right,” I said, thinking that if we could get this task done quickly, perhaps there was still a chance for the other Draco to make an appearance. “What about the yellow one you wore to Lyra's christening?”</p><p>“Too daywear. The black one I wore to dinner with Pansy and Theo last month?”</p><p>“Oh, that one was fucking hot, I wanted to tear that dress off of you with my teeth. Wear that,” I breathed into her neck, hoping to get the sex option back on the table.</p><p>“So not that. Did you not hear the not sleazy, not slutty part?” She ran back into the closet, bringing out a svelte maroon dress.</p><p>“That's beautiful. I love that one.”</p><p>Back to the closet. Now, a full skirted green party dress. “Yes?”</p><p>“Yes,” I said.</p><p>“No,” she answered.</p><p>Now, svelte maroon again.</p><p>“Trick question. That's the same dress from earlier.”</p><p>She looks at me as though I have grown an additional head. “This one is entirely different. It's crepe, not silk. And the other one had a split and spaghetti straps!”</p><p>“Er–”</p><p>But she was already back in the closet. I checked my watch. We needed to be at the restaurant in less than thirty minutes, and Hermione's parents would be here in ten. Other Draco gave up his hopes and ambitions for the moment, sadly.</p><p>She came back out in the navy blue dress that she started in.</p><p>“I truly love this one,” I said, and I meant it.</p><p>“Okay. But maybe the maroon–”</p><p>“Hermione!”</p><p>“You're right. Let's see, I just need to check the manuscript–” she paused, listening with a critical ear at the silence that echoed from downstairs. “Draco, where is Leo?”</p><p>“Er– He's playing in the den.”</p><p>“The den– by my office?”</p><p>“Y– yes?”</p><p>“And was the door to my office locked or unlocked when you came upstairs?”</p><p>“Er–”</p><p>She eyed me fiercely, then tore down the stairs, beating me to the office door.</p><p>“No! Nononono, oh Draco, how could you let this happen? What am I going to do?”</p><p>“I can fix it, Hermione just give me a minute, I'll be right back!” I told her.</p><p>She blocked the door with her body. “NO! You are not leaving this room. Every single page of this fifteen hundred page manuscript will have to be individually scourgified! And– Oh Merlin, he knows how to use the shredder? Yes! He knows! How many pages do you think he shredded?!”</p><p>“I think the better question is, why do we even own a shredder? Can't you just evanesco or incendio it?”</p><p>“Noooo,” she moaned. “The Muggle side of the publishing house requires everyone to own a shredder, oh my gods, Draco! What am I going to do? What am I going to say?”</p><p>“Just give me two minutes, I can fix this–” I started for the door again.</p><p>She whipped out her wand. “Colloportus!”</p><p>“Hermione, was that really necessary? Come on darling–”</p><p>There was an insistent tapping on the window. I crossed to the window and peered out, just able to make out the figure of Colwin, my parents’ owl.</p><p>“Do not– DO NOT– take an owl right now, Draco, I –”</p><p>“It's Colwin, pet, I just need to check–”</p><p>I opened the window a crack, and the majestic bird stepped inside, holding out a taloned foot. I took the scroll gingerly, recognizing my mother's seal. She had not messaged me in such a way since my grandmother Druella had passed two years before. My heart sank into my stomach, and Hermione came up behind me, putting her arm around me.</p><p>“What is it?” She asked softly, scared.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>The Manor was bathed in sunlight, a cruel trick on such an awful day, as it was. Linda and Stephen had agreed to stay with Leo and Lyra, allowing us time with my parents.</p><p>Mum answered the door and I pulled her in immediately for a hug. “He's in his study,” she said.</p><p>“How are you, Mum?”</p><p>“I'm fucking furious,” she answered me stoically. “I refuse to entertain even the possibility of a life without your father.”</p><p>“Narcissa…” Hermione began, putting her arms around Mum.</p><p>I hurried past them, passing the door of the parlor on my way. Cousin Regulus stood inside.</p><p>“You've heard, then?”</p><p>I stopped at the sound of his voice. “Yes.”</p><p>“It's hot today. I don't care for it.”</p><p>I grimaced. Some days, it was hard to have a rational conversation with Cousin Regulus. It looked like this was shaping up to be one of those days.</p><p>“Draco, at your wedding, your father said that he loved me. That was the best day of my life. So, I think that would make today the worst day.”</p><p>Tears sprang to my eyes, and I wiped them quickly. “Yes, Reg, I quite agree.”</p><p>We nodded at each other, and Regulus turned to look out the window at the Manor gardens. I continued on to the study.</p><p>“Oh, you too? Merlin and Morgana, who hasn't your mother told?”</p><p>“I think that's everyone,” I answered.</p><p>“Pansy was just in here blubbering about nonsensically.”</p><p>“How did it happen?”</p><p>“Ahh, It was rather foolish of me, I know. Long before you were in the picture, I smoked a lot of cigarettes. Filthy habit, but one I couldn't really break until you came along. It was likely that. I stopped, of course, but it was too late. And all of the damage was done before you were born, so…”</p><p>“So you couldn't go back and change it,” I finished for him. I nodded in understanding, a couple of silent tears tracking down my cheeks. “And the healers at St Mungo's?”</p><p>“No, they can't do anything about it. The damage is too great.”</p><p>“How long do you have?”</p><p>“Oh, it could be years.”</p><p>“But how long, really?”</p><p>“Really? Weeks, possibly. Maybe a couple of months..”</p><p>It struck me how calm he was, and a thought occurred to me. “How many times have we had this conversation?”</p><p>“Several. Perhaps a dozen.” Father smiled a bit sadly at me.</p><p>“And what happened those times?”</p><p>His smile grew fainter. “I rather let myself down. I hugged you and we cried.”</p><p>I crossed the room to him and pulled him into a strong hug. He felt light, brittle in my grasp. I fought a sob. “I thought with the whole time thing–”</p><p>“No. Remember, I told you– we can't go back and fix things. I specifically said that. Life is an unknown, a cauldron full of possibilities, good and bad. No matter who you are.”</p><p>“That's true,” I said. “But you must feel a bit cheated.”</p><p>“No– The only people who don't need to work are the indecently wealthy and time travelers who get cancer and want to spend more time playing skittles with their son. I just happened to be both.”</p><p>We laughed together, and he said, “now I want to tell you the real secret, the big one. It's my secret formula for happiness in life.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>We returned to London two days later, and I tried to put Father's advice into action.</p><p>Part one of his two-part plan was to live the day just as you always would, in an ordinary way, just like everyone else.</p><p>I got up, had breakfast with my adorable children and my beautiful wife whilst skimming The Daily Prophet. I hurriedly kissed them goodbye, and apparated to the closest apparition point to my office in muggle London.</p><p>I stopped at the quaint muggle coffee shop, where the harried barista always spelled my name with a KE instead of a CO. I grimaced and nodded my thanks.</p><p>That morning, Ernie and I had a meeting with a top client, who ripped us new arseholes for something that wasn't our fault. We left the meeting anxious and upset, going back to our offices in silence. My lunch, Ernie's sausage sandwich with chips, was not the chicken salad on rye that I'd ordered. I walked to his office and placed it on the desk, quietly taking my own. He was facing the window and didn't turn around. I went back to my own office and ate in silence.</p><p>That night, Leo had a small meltdown over mushy peas. Apparently, though last week they were his favorite, this week he had never liked mushy peas, detested them with a passion and heat of a thousand suns, and let us know his distaste by throwing them onto the floor.</p><p>Lyra, who was teething, refused to be consoled until well after midnight. She cried for 20 minutes as I shushed her, patting her back.</p><p>Hermione and I fell into bed, exhausted.</p><p>“How was your day?” She asked tiredly.</p><p>“A bit miserable, yours?”</p><p>“Kind of the same. Not all of it though,” and she rolled against me, snuggling her head into my chest.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>But then came part two of Father's plan.</p><p>He told me to live every day again almost exactly the same, this time noticing all of the tiny sweet, tender, funny, heartfelt things that made any day special.</p><p>At breakfast, Leo and I made up a song about waffles that had Lyra in belly laughs. When I kissed Hermione goodbye for the day, she pulled me against her and I dragged my tongue and lips lazily across her neck. She moaned quietly in my ear, obscured by the sound of Leo's new favorite waffle song.</p><p>At the Muggle coffee shop, I smiled at the barista who insisted that my name was Drake. I made small talk with the little old lady behind me in line, who told me about her cat, Mr Tibbles. I took my cup that had someone else's name on it, feeling as if I were trying on an alternate life for a few minutes.</p><p>At the meeting with the prick client, whilst his spittle flew across the table at me and Ernie, I held up a file to Ernie upon which I had dashed a quick note. <em> this guy must have the world's tiniest dick that he is trying to make up for.</em> Ernie cracked a smile that he quickly covered with his hand. When the client was done ranting, we did our level best to smooth things over. And if it didn't work, who cared, really? It wasn't the end of the world, we still made plenty of money for the firm.</p><p>Back at the office, I brought Ernie's lunch to him and he passed mine to me. We sat in his office together, making fun of the client, talking about Quidditch and the girl Ernie was seeing, and what Leo and Lyra were up to this week.</p><p>At dinner, I scooped a big mouthful of Leo's mushy peas into my mouth, then dabbed a bit on my nose.</p><p>“No, Daddy! That's mine! That's not what you do with them! Look, me!” And Leo finished the peas, scraping the plate clean.</p><p>Lyra, bless her, cried for twenty solid minutes as I rocked her and sang to her, patting her back.</p><p>Hermione and I fell into bed, exhausted.</p><p>“How was your day?” She asked tiredly.</p><p>I reflected a minute. “Kind of wonderful, actually.”</p><p>“Oh, thank goodness! If you had said that you had a miserable day, I would have had to take pity on you and have sex with you,” she giggled, rolling away from me and picking up a book.</p><p>“Well, in that case, it was a miserable day. The absolute worst. The only thing that can make it better is your delightful body writhing under my delightful body.” I pulled her back to me, rolling over and pushing my thigh between her legs.</p><p>“Mmmnnn, How do you keep doing this to me?” She wailed to herself, kissing my neck and running her fingers softly over my chest. “Gods, you're so fucking fit.”</p><p>I moved quickly down her body. “You'll be the end of me yet, love,” I murmured, sliding her knickers down her legs and rubbing my tongue softly against her beautiful center.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, after she had come once on my tongue, twice on my hand, and one final time on my cock, I lay back, spent, with the widest, stupidest grin on my face. Hermione rolled on top of me, mirroring the same grin back at me.</p><p>“One more time? Or is the world's most perfect wizard just going to give up and fall asleep?”</p><p>I chuckle. “Never, witch! But I'll need a few minutes to catch my breath.”</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>But there are some days that you never want to live again.</p><p>Thirty four days after we found out about the cancer, two days after we'd returned from Wilshire for a visit, Father passed away quietly in his sleep. As Pansy and I helped Mum with the last minute arrangements, it hardly seemed fair, that I was the only one who could still see him as he once was.</p><p>I stepped into the cupboard in my childhood bedroom, and emerged a year earlier. I found him reading a novel in his study.</p><p>“For the life of me, I will never understand why Golding killed off Piggy,” he said, tossing the book to the sofa. “Where have you just come from?”</p><p>At my somber look, working very hard to hold back my tears, he simply said, “oh. That.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You've put me in my grey robes?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And they're playing the–?”</p><p>“Yes, Queen’s greatest hits, ending with ‘Who Wants to Live Forever.’ Though I must warn you, you're ruining that song for Mum.”</p><p>“Ah, it's all right, she always thought it dragged on far too long anyway. Which is quite frankly ridiculous, her favorite is ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ and that's nearly six minutes. Much too long for a funeral dirge, certainly. But please– Skip ‘Another One Bites The Dust,’ will you? That's just crass.”</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and laughed, then leaned over the back of the sofa to give him a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He patted me on the arm. I stood there for several minutes with my arms around his shoulders, Neither of us wanted to speak.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>It was a mostly quiet affair, only the family and a few close friends. Theo was there to support Pansy. Linda and Stephen and Severus and Hestia and Ernie and Ginny had come to pay their respects. The handful of aunts and uncles and family friends and neighbors murmured their sympathies to us over the strains of Queen.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Back home in London that night, after we'd tucked Leo in with one story from Beedle the Bard and another from the Brothers Grimm, Hermione suggested a drink on the back verandah.</p><p>“I've been thinking,” she said, swirling her spiced vodka and cranberry juice.</p><p>“Uh-oh, that's never good,” I smiled at her, settling next to her on the swing and putting an arm out so that she could snuggle in close.</p><p>“Hush,” she said in mock admonishment. “I want to have another one.”</p><p>“Another–?”</p><p>“Another baby.”</p><p>I froze. “Oh,” was all I could say.</p><p>“Think about it. I was an only child, and you had Pansy, but even that wasn't planned on your parents’ part–”</p><p>“Mum always said she wished there had been more of us, but it just wasn't in the cards.”</p><p>“Exactly. But we've got the time,” Hermione said.</p><p>I breathed deeply. She was right– we did have the time, but she had no idea what that time actually meant.</p><p>She continued. “When the two of us are gone, they'll only have each other.”</p><p>“Won't that be a good thing?”</p><p>“Yes, but what if they don't get along? What if they fight and need a mediator or a tie breaker? Or…” her voice trailed off.</p><p>‘Or…” I prompted.</p><p>Now her voice got very small, and I knew I was about to hear her real reasoning. “Or Merlin forbid, what if something happens to one of them, and then they really are alone once we're gone?”</p><p>I hugged her close. I knew that she, like I, was visualizing Pansy in her hospital bed.</p><p>She was right. Life was fragile, and we weren't guaranteed anything.</p><p>But I wasn't ready to say goodbye to my father for the last time.</p><p>It was the toughest decision of my life.</p><p>“Give me a bit of time to think about it,” I asked.</p><p>“Okay,” she said agreeably. Then, twenty seconds or so later, she asked, “how about now?”</p><p>I laughed. “Yes,” I said. “All right.” Who knows? I thought. We might not even be successful when we tried this time, or it might take us a year to get pregnant again.</p><center>
  <p>-O-</p>
</center><p>Eleven months later, we fell into bed next to each other, exhausted. Hermione moaned pleasurably.</p><p>I grinned next to her tiredly. “Darling, if I'd known that you wanted to come to bed and make those lascivious noises, I would have gotten you here faster.”</p><p>“It just feels so good to lay down,” she said, with those same decadent moans. “I can't reach my feet. Can you take off my socks?”</p><p>“I can take off anything of yours that you want me to,” I said, sitting up and waggling my brows at her.</p><p>“Just the socks right now, Romeo,” she laughed. “My belly is so big, I haven't even seen my feet in weeks.”</p><p>It was true; I had been putting on and taking off her socks for over a month now. The time was drawing very close. Mom, Pansy, Linda, and Stephen were all on standby, waiting for the floo call that it was time. Our bag for St Mungo's was packed, and Leo and Lyra were demanding to know each morning if Mummy was ready to give them the baby today.</p><p>Leo was a precocious almost 4-year-old who had an endless thirst for simple math problems, and would challenge any adult to a math battle if they were still long enough. Lyra seemed to go directly from crawling to running, and made up lively songs to narrate her day as she went along. The two of them worked together to create mischief wherever they went, and they were excited for the prospect of a new playmate to join them and become a trio.</p><p>Sockless, Hermione was dozing off in a matter of seconds. She roused long enough to ask, “did you lock the doors and set the wards?”</p><p>“Let me just go down and check,” I said.</p><p>I crept quietly down the stairs, checking the house's security that I knew I had checked three times already tonight. I paused a moment, listening. Then I stepped quickly into the pantry and disapparated to the gardens at the manor at Wiltshire.</p><p>The house was quiet. I knew that Mum and Regulus were out, and that Father would be in his study. I had visited this day before, but tonight would be the last time.</p><p>I pushed open the study door, and stepped inside.</p><p>“Weren't you just here?” My father raised one eyebrow at me.</p><p>“Just thought I would pop back in a moment,” I said lightly. “Fancy a game of skittles?”</p><p>“Always,” Father said.</p><p>We made quick work of setting up the pins just so. I took an early lead in the match, but Father's prodigious skill and magical luck won out.</p><p>“Aha! Once again age and wisdom triumph over good looks and intelligence,” he crowed, delighted. I can't help but chuckle at him. “What do I get as my prize?”</p><p>“I think a kiss shall have to do,” I said quietly, fearing the tremble in my voice.</p><p>“A kiss? What kind of prize is that?” then he looked me in my eyes. “Oh.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“The baby is on its way, is it?”</p><p>“Yes. Any day now.”</p><p>“And you're quite certain about the name?”</p><p>“We're not changing our minds,” I said warningly.</p><p>“And the others?”</p><p>They're perfect. A joy to have around. I never knew it could be this way,” I said falteringly, quick tears springing to my eyes as I thought of Leo and Lyra.</p><p>“And everyone else?”</p><p>“Mum is… coping. Some days she talks about you as though you've just stepped out to take a walk. She and Regulus are good for each other, though. They make each other try new things now, more. They've traveled a bit, joined a mahjong club with Linda, and they go to trivia nights at the Crash and Burn on some Wednesdays.”</p><p>“We used to do trivia at the Leaky before you were born,” Father smiled. “Your mother knows about so many things that she has probably forgotten more trivia than most people ever knew.”</p><p>“Pansy is a few months along now. She and Theo are planning a little garden wedding after the baby is born. She says she plans to walk up the aisle to ‘We Are The Champions,’” I said.</p><p>“As she should, that only makes sense,” Father said reasonably.</p><p>“Is… is there anything you'd like to do? A game of lawn bowling? Act out that parrot scene from Python?”</p><p>Father thought a moment. “There is something… Quite against the rules, you know, or at least a bit of a gray area, but I think if we're very careful, and I do all of the work… Yes, I think it will be okay.”</p><p>He stood and strode to the door. I followed him. Out in the corridor, he opened the door to a small cupboard and gestured me inside.</p><p>He held my hands, and I made my mind blank, waiting. A slight tug of magic, and we were there– whenever there was.</p><p>I looked up at Father, something I had not done since I was a child. We had been the same height since I was fourteen.</p><p>We stepped out the door, and I looked down to realize that I was quite small, perhaps only eight or nine years old.</p><p>“Let's go!” Father said warmly, next to me. He was young, younger than I had seen him for so long. We raced outside, grabbing our brooms and a quaffle from the small broom shed. We tossed the ball back and forth for some time, then landed. Pansy was setting up a game of croquet, and the five of us argued over who got to be the green ball. We had lemonade and curry chicken sandwiches. Cousin Regulus built a fire, and we roasted marshmallows and sang silly songs.</p><p>Regulus doused the fire and Mum vanished the dishes whilst Pansy played solo croquet in the dark. Father turned to me.</p><p>“Thank you for today,” he said.</p><p>“I'll love you always,” I said.</p><center>

</center><p>And so, life went on, as it does for everybody. We became our own family of five, and baby Lucas proved to be the perfect compliment to Leo and Lyra's trio.</p><p>Pansy and Theo’s small garden wedding was the spectacle we'd all come to expect from them, which is to say, it was fabulous. It had been a change, getting used to seeing Pansy happy again, getting used to seeing her as a mother, albeit sometimes a kooky one, to baby Abraxas.</p><center>

</center><p>And in the end, I think I learned the final lesson from my travels in time. I've even gone one step further than my father did.</p><p>The truth is, I seldom travel back at all these days, not even for a few minutes to avoid an argument with Hermione or a bit of embarrassment at work, or a scraped knee for my children.</p><p>Instead, I simply try to live every day as if I've deliberately come back to this one particular day to enjoy it as if it was the full final day of my extraordinary, magical life.</p><p>All of us are traveling through time together every day of our lives. It's up to us to find the joy on this beautiful journey.</p>
